abstract = {AbstractThe term “environmental flows” is now widely used to reflect the hydrological regime required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems, and the human livelihoods and well-being that depend on them. The definition suggests a central role for ecohydrological science to help determine a required flow regime for a target ecosystem condition. Indeed, many countries have established laws and policies to implement environmental flows with the expectation that science can deliver the answers. This article provides an overview of recent developments and applications of environmental flows on six continents to explore the changing role of ecohydrological sciences, recognizing its limitations and the emerging needs of society, water resource managers and policy makers. Science has responded with new methods to link hydrology to ecosystem status, but these have also raised fundamental questions that go beyond ecohydrology, such as who decides on the target condition of the ecosystem? Some environmental flow methods are based on the natural flow paradigm, which assumes the desired regime is the natural “unmodified” condition. However, this may be unrealistic where flow regimes have been altered for many centuries and are likely to change with future climate change. Ecosystems are dynamic, so the adoption of environmental flows needs to have a similar dynamic basis. Furthermore, methodological developments have been made in two directions: first, broad-scale hydrological analysis of flow regimes (assuming ecological relevance of hydrograph components) and, second, analysis of ecological impacts of more than one stressor (e.g. flow, morphology, water quality). All methods retain a degree of uncertainty, which translates into risks, and raises questions regarding trust between scientists and the public. Communication between scientists, social scientists, practitioners, policy makers and the public is thus becoming as important as the quality of the science. Editor Z.W.

abstract = {The term “environmental flows” describes the quantities, quality, and patterns of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. Environmental flows may be achieved in a number of different ways, most of which are based on either (1) limiting alterations from the natural flow baseline to maintain biodiversity and ecological integrity or (2) designing flow regimes to achieve specific ecological and ecosystem service outcomes. We argue that the former practice is more applicable to natural and semi-natural rivers where the primary objective and opportunity is ecological conservation. The latter “designer” approach is better suited to modified and managed rivers where return to natural conditions is no longer feasible and the objective is to maximize natural capital as well as support economic growth, recreation, or cultural history. This permits elements of ecosystem design and adaptation to environmental change. In a future characterized by altered climates and intensive regulation, where hybrid and novel aquatic ecosystems predominate, the designer approach may be the only feasible option. This conclusion stems from a lack of natural ecosystems from which to draw analogs and the need to support broader socioeconomic benefits and valuable configurations of natural and social capital.},

abstract = {Of the many “equilibrium” terms that have been proposed, only two are needed: dynamic equilibrium in the original sense of G.K. Gilbert (1877) and steady state. The former refers to the relationship between the process components of a system, the latter to the system as a whole. The tendency towards establishing a dynamic equilibrium is inherent in all natural systems that contain negative feedbacks between processes capable of compensating each other. In geomorphology, equilibrium tendencies of the mass budget are more relevant than those of the energy budget. The validity of the equilibrium concept is discussed at several scales from a slope point to entire slopes, drainage basins and mountain ranges. The effects of eksystemic changes vary depending upon the length of the intervals between such changes in comparison to the length of the required relaxation times. This relationship also applies to the influence of inherited forms, patterns and materials that have become components of present-day systems.},

abstract = {The evolution of gravel bed rivers under cycled hydrographs and constant sediment supply is studied in this paper. With the aid of numerical modeling and flume experiments, previous research has indicated that under such water and sediment supply conditions, a river can reach a mobile-bed equilibrium characterized by a hydrograph boundary layer (HBL) located near the upstream end of the river. The HBL defines the spatial region within which riverbed topography and grain size respond to the hydrograph, and downstream of which these bed characteristics are invariant. However, neither the governing physical mechanisms nor the general applicability of the HBL is yet well understood. In this paper, we implement a 1-D morphodynamic model for this problem. The model is first validated with data for both flume experiments and numerical simulations. It is then implemented at field scale with grain size distributions varying from uniform sediment to very poorly sorted sediment mixtures. Our results show that the idea of an HBL is applicable in the case of uniform sediment, but breaks down in the case of poorly sorted sediment mixtures. In such cases, persistent low-amplitude bed load sheets emerge along the entire channel reach, in addition to HBL-like upstream boundary effects. Bed load sheets can be described as surface texture or grain size sorting waves in consonance with low-amplitude elevation variations, and are ascribed to nonlinear advection terms in the governing equations that vanish for uniform sediment, but become significant when sediment is very poorly sorted.},

abstract = {This paper concerns a model of bed load transport, which describes the advection and dispersion of coarse particles carried by a turbulent water stream. The challenge is to develop a microstructural approach that, on the one hand, yields a parsimonious description of particle transport at the microscopic scale and, on the other hand, leads to averaged equations at the macroscopic scale that can be consistently interpreted in light of the continuum equations used in hydraulics. The cornerstone of the theory is the proper determination of the particle flux fluctuations. Apart from turbulence-induced noise, fluctuations in the particle transport rate are generated by particle exchanges with the bed consisting of particle entrainment and deposition. At the particle scale, the evolution of the number of moving particles can be described probabilistically using a coupled set of reaction–diffusion master equations. Theoretically, this is interesting but impractical, as solving the governing equations is fraught with difficulty. Using the Poisson representation, we show that these multivariate master equations can be converted into Fokker–Planck equations without any simplifying approximations. Thus, in the continuum limit, we end up with a Langevin-like stochastic partial differential equation that governs the time and space variations of the probability density function for the number of moving particles. For steady-state flow conditions and a fixed control volume, the probability distributions of the number of moving particles and the particle flux can be calculated analytically. Taking the average of the microscopic governing equations leads to an average mass conservation equation, which takes the form of the classic Exner equation under certain conditions carefully addressed in the paper. Analysis also highlights the specific part played by a process we refer to as collective entrainment, i.e. a nonlinear feedback process in particle entrainment. In the absence of collective entrainment the fluctuations in the number of moving particles are Poissonian, which implies that at the macroscopic scale they act as white noise that mediates bed evolution. In contrast, when collective entrainment occurs, large non-Poissonian fluctuations arise, with the important consequence that the evolution at the macroscopic scale may depart significantly that predicted by the averaged Exner equation. Comparison with experimental data gives satisfactory results for steady-state flows.},

The experiments show the existence of an unstable stratification of collisional and frictional regimes, and, with reference to the time integrated variables, to a relatively smooth transition between the two regimes. The experimental data were interpreted following Bagnold's theory and the kinetic theories. Finally, the paper presents and discusses global relationships in uniform flow condition among depth-integrated parameters (slope, solid and liquid average concentrations, average velocity, water and grains flow depth).},

abstract = {Pool-riffle sequences play a central role in providing habitat diversity conditions both in terms of flow and substrate in gravel bed streams. Understanding their capacity to self-maintain has been the focus of research for many years, starting with the velocity reversal hypothesis. This hypothesis relied only on cross sectional averaged flow information, but its limited success prompted extensions of the hypothesis and alternative explanations for self-maintenance. Significant advances beyond the velocity reversal hypothesis have been achieved by incorporating more information either on flow or sediment transport characteristics. However, this has been done in a compartmentalised way, with studies either focusing on one or the other aspect.This work bridges the gap between these two aspects by using an approximate methodology that combines observed characteristic stage-dependent 3-D flow patterns with time-varying cross sectional information on bed shear stresses, sediment distribution and sediment bed changes during a one-year record of continuous discharges from a real stream. This methodology allows us to track the behaviour of different sediment size fractions along flow streamlines over time and identify self-maintenance conditions due to the combined effect of both flow multi-dimensionality and sediment transport.We apply this approximate methodology to two contiguous pools and riffles and demonstrate that, unexpectedly, they may rely on different mechanisms for self-maintenance due to differences in geometry and sediment size distribution. We also demonstrate that our methodology is potentially overarching and integrative of previous partial approaches based on flow multidimensionality or sediment transport, which tend to underestimate the occurrence of self-maintenance.

Here we present new theoretical equations for the graded alluvial river profile that account for the effects of particle abrasion and grain size selective transport in the absence of subsidence, uplift, and sea level change. Under graded conditions we find that abrasion results in a mild profile concavity and downstream fining, whereas under aggradational conditions grain size selective transport can lead to large spatial changes in channel slope and bed surface mean grain size.},

abstract = {[1] Despite the wide spectrum of perturbations of flow and sediment transport experienced by rivers as a result of hydrologic variations, the paradigm of morphodynamic equilibrium has long been present in the geomorphological literature where it is traditionally associated with the semiempirical notion of formative discharge, whereby the unsteady forcing is taken as morphologically equivalent to some effective steady forcing. Here we investigate the mechanisms responsible for maintaining a quasi-equilibrium bed profile of a river reach sufficiently short to have no significant tributary inputs. More importantly, we assume the channel banks to be fixed, hence, the case we have in mind is that of rivers protected by levees which cannot respond to hydrologic forcing by changing their width like natural rivers. Employing a 1-D model of river morphodynamics, we first determine the equilibrium profile of the river reach for given steady forcing conditions and discuss the capability of this approach for interpreting bed profiles observed in the field by applying it to the terminal reach of the Magra River, Italy. Field observations turn out to be reasonably well fitted by the equilibrium profile associated with a steady effective discharge, which however differs from the typical formative discharge (mean annual flood) for natural channels with erodible banks. Finally, we clarify how fluctuations of the hydrodynamic forcing associated with the recorded historical sequence of hydrologic events of variable intensities have acted to maintain the river equilibrium.},

abstract = {Fluid–sediment interactions control river channel forms and processes. Analysis of spatial hydraulic patterns and the resulting boundary shear stress are required to aid understanding of river system behaviour. In this paper, the hydraulic processes active in a natural pool–riffle sequence are simulated using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Methods employed for the prescription of model boundary conditions are outlined. Model calculations are assessed using comparisons with field observations acquired over a range of flows. Simulations are then used to illustrate flow structures and patterns of boundary shear stress for a near-bankfull and an intermediate flow event. Results are used to assess existing theories that seek to explain the development and maintenance of pool–riffle sequences. Simulated results suggestthat near-bed velocities and bedshear stresses decrease onriffles and increase in pools as discharge increases.Model simulations indicate that secondary flow acts to route near-bed flow over the downstream side of riffles and into the pool- head away from the centre of pools. Implications for sediment transport and pool maintenance are discussed.},

abstract = {Meandering rivers are common on Earth and other planetary surfaces, yet the conditions necessary to maintain meandering channels are unclear. As a consequence, self-maintaining meandering channels with cutoffs have not been reproduced in the laboratory. Such experimental channels are needed to explore mechanisms controlling migration rate, sinuosity, floodplain formation, and planform morphodynamics and to test theories for wavelength and bend propagation. Here we report an experiment in which meandering with near-constant width was maintained during repeated cutoff and regeneration of meander bends. We found that elevated bank strength (provided by alfalfa sprouts) relative to the cohesionless bed material and the blocking of troughs (chutes) in the lee of point bars via suspended sediment deposition were the necessary ingredients to successful meandering. Varying flood discharge was not necessary. Scaling analysis shows that the experimental meander migration was fast compared to most natural channels. This high migration rate caused nearly all of the bedload sediment to exchange laterally, such that bar growth was primarily dependent on bank sediment supplied from upstream lateral migration. The high migration rate may have contributed to the relatively low sinuosity of 1.19, and this suggests that to obtain much higher sinuosity experiments at this scale may have to be conducted for several years. Although patience is required to evolve them, these experimental channels offer the opportunity to explore several fundamental issues about river morphodynamics. Our results also suggest that sand supply may be an essential control in restoring self-maintaining, actively shifting gravel-bedded meanders.},

@book{Bridge2003,
abstract = {Rivers and Floodplains is concerned with the origin, geometry, water flow, sediment transport, erosion and deposition associated with modern alluvial rivers and floodplains, how they vary in time and space, and how this information is used to interpret deposits of ancient rivers and floodplains. There is specific reference to the types and lifestyles of organisms associated with fluvial environments, human interactions with rivers and floodplains, associated environmental and engineering concerns, as well as the economic aspects of fluvial deposits, particularly the modeling of fluvial hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers. Methods of studying rivers and floodplains and their deposits are also discussed. Although basic principles are emphasized, many examples are detailed. Particular emphasis is placed on how an understanding of the nature of modern rivers and floodplains is required before any problems concerning rivers and floodplains, past or present, can be addressed rationally. Rivers and Floodplains is designed as a core text for senior undergraduate and graduate students studying modern or ancient fluvial environments, particularly in earth sciences, environmental sciences and physical geography, but also in civil and agricultural engineering. College teachers, researchers, and practising professionals will also find the book an invaluable reference. Presents a process-based approach, which is relevant to modern curricula. Discusses methods of studying rivers and floodplains and their deposits. Provides many detailed examples throughout the text. Emphasises the basic principles of this subject. As the first synthesis of this entire field, it will be a must-have for all students studying modern or ancient fluvial environments. Teachers, researchers and practising professionals will find this an invaluable reference tool. Rivers and Floodplains will also be of interest to geologists, geographers and engineers.},

That year serves as a boundary between the two main parts of this article, a chronological review of JWT's contributions, decade by decade.

abstract = {The general concepts generated by modern studies of geomorphological processes are examined in terms of their utility for models of long-term landform evolution. The work is summarized by four fundamental propositions of landform genesis. These include the idea that each set of environments is represented by constant processes and characteristic landforms which tend to persist over time. 'Geomorphological' time is divided into the time taken to attain this characteristic state and the time over which it persists. The systems and forms are subject, over 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}5{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} years, to perturbations caused by high magnitude-low frequency events, environmental change and internal structural instabilities which initiate change. The responses to these impulses are complex and include damped, sustained and reinforcing changes taking place by ubiquitous, linear or diffusive propagation which reflect the sensitivity of the landscape to change. This sensitivity is dependent on the path density of the process and the strength of the coupling between the system components and has two end members, mobile-sensitive systems and slowly responding-insensitive areas. Some of the results include the concepts of (1) relief and pattern persistence; (2) stagnancy of development and the hypothesis of unequal activity; (3) convergence of form; (4) the concept of transient forms; (5) stability-instability phases and episodic landscape evolution, which together form a coherent framework for long-term landform evolution.},

abstract = {Measurement of the structure of gravel-bed river surfaces is crucial for understanding both bed roughness and the sediment entrainment process. This paper describes the use of close range digital photogrammetry to measure and monitor change occurring in submerged river gravel-beds in both flume and field environments. High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) were obtained and two-media (through air and water) techniques were used to correct for the e.ects of refraction at the air/water interface. Although suitable refractive models have been developed, the use of proprietary software to generate DEMs automatically introduces the problem of how to re-establish collinearity. A simple refraction correction algorithm based upon analytical geometry was developed and is described. This algorithm was designed for use after initial DEM acquisition and allows any photogrammetric software package to be used for data acquisition. Application of this algorithm led to improvements in DEM accuracy by reducing the systematic, depth-dependent bias caused by refraction Research carried out in a flume environment allowed the algorithm to be tested by measuring a flooded and drained bed surface. Non-systematic differences between the “dry” and “wet” DEMs arose from reductions in stereomatching success in the two-media case. This effect was thought to be due to light attenuation and the introduction of residual parallax. Results suggest that close range digital photogrammetry can be used to extract high quality DEMs of submerged topography in both flume and field fluvial environments, which represents a particularly exciting development for fluvial geomorphologists},

abstract = {A computational study is presented on the hydraulics of a natural pool–rifﬂe sequence composed of mixed cobbles, pebbles and sand in the River Lune, northern England. A depth-averaged two-dimensional numerical model is employed, calibrated with observed data at the ﬁeld site. From the computational outputs, the occurrence of longitudinally double peak zones of bed shear stress and velocity is found. In particular, at low discharge there exists a primary peak zone of bed shear stress and velocity at the rifﬂe tail in line with the local maximum energy slope, in addition to a secondary peak at the pool head. As discharge increases, the primary peak at the rifﬂe tail at low ﬂow moves toward the upstream side of the rifﬂe along with the maximum energy slope, showing progressive equalization to the surrounding hydraulic proﬁles. Concurrently, the secondary peak, due to channel constriction, appears to stand at the pool head, with its value increasing with discharge and approaching or exceeding the primary peak over the rifﬂe. The existence of ﬂow reversal is demonstrated for this speciﬁc case, which is attributable to channel constriction at the pool head. A dynamic equilibrium model is presented to reconstruct the pool–rifﬂe morphology. A series of numerical modelling exercises demonstrates that the pool–rifﬂe morphology is more likely produced by shallow ﬂows concentrated with coarse sediments than deep ﬂows laden with low concentrations of ﬁne sediments. It is concluded that channel constriction can, but may not necessarily, lead to competence reversal, depending on channel geometry, ﬂow discharge and sediment properties.

abstract = {Gravel dunes are rarely reported owing to comparative rarity of occurrence and generic confusion with antidunes and classes of gravel bars. A compilation of data from the literature for sediments with a median size greater than 2 mm shows that dunes have been developed in the laboratory in median grain sizes up to 28.6 mm. For field conditions, there are data for grain sizes up to 60 mm. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium gravel dunes range in length from less than 0.6 m to greater than 100 m. Heights range from less than 0.1 m to 16 m. Height and length data for the steepest three-dimensional (3-D) gravel dunes are consistent with the H:L function reported by Ashley (1990) for equilibrium dunes developed in sand. For a broad range of dune length, 3-D gravel dunes are steeper than two-dimensional (2-D) dunes, but for L {\textgreater} 100 m and H {\textgreater} 8 m there are too few data to draw any conclusion. Ashley's H:L function does not apply to a broad range of 2-D gravel dunes. A separate well defined function is proposed to describe the H:L relationship for 2-D gravel dunes of maximum steepness. There are few data on the hydrodynamic development of gravel dunes. As a guide, gravel dunes develop for a range of Froude numbers up to 0.75 given that the nondimensional mean bed shear stress (theta) exceeds circa 0.1. Dunes reach their maximum height at theta = 0.25 and have reduced in height when theta = 0.3. Froude numbers of 0.84 and above lead to crestal flattening, dune diminution, and eventual replacement by antidunes or upper-stage plane beds. However, owing to lag effects, transitional bedforms have been recorded for Froude numbers near the critical value of 1. The development of gravel dune steepness from lower-stage plane bed through to upper-stage plane bed is well described in only one case, by Dinehart (1992a). Fredsoe's (1975) theta function for equilibrium dune steepness applies reasonably well to Dinehart's steepest dunes. Allen's (1984) bedform existence field based on theta and a characteristic grain size of the bed sediment has been extended from 5 mm to include bedstocks as coarse as 33 mm.},

abstract = {The ‘velocity-reversal hypothesis' is the linchpin for a number of recent conceptual models pertaining to sediment sorting and the maintenance of pool-riffle sequences in gravel-bedded streams. The literature in support of the hypothesis together with published adverse criticism is reviewed. It is concluded that convincing evidence for the ubiquitous occurrence of such a reversal in a range of channel geometries is currently unavailable. Continuity considerations indicate that riffles need to be considerably wider than pools for a reversal in the mean velocity to occur under conditions of subcritical flow, high stage, and stable morphology. These observations are substantiated by a detailed study of the hydraulic geometry of stable pool-riffle sequences in the River Severn, England. Neither the sectionally-averaged velocity nor the near-bed shear velocity is sensibly greater in the pools than over the riffles during bankfull or near bankfull flow. Instead a tendency towards equalization of the values of average hydraulic variables is noted as discharge increases. A detailed investigation of the three-dimensional character of the flow is required to demonstrate whether the entrainment forces within pools can locally exceed those over neighbouring riffles. Unusual behaviour of the energy gradient over riffles during moderate discharges is related to backwater effects as mediated by the spacing of the riffles. The hydraulic data are used to comment on the stability of the test reaches in the context of the development of the River Severn in the vicinity of Shrewsbury.},

abstract = {The etymology and historic usage of such terms as 'anabranch', 'anastamose' and 'braided' within river science are reviewed. Despite several decades of modern research to define river channel typologies inclusive of single channels and multiple channel networks, typologies remain ill-conditioned and consequently ill-defined. Conventionally employed quantitative planform characteristics of river networks possibly cannot be used alone to define channel types, yet the planform remains a central part of all modern classification schemes, supplemented by sedimentological and other qualitative channel characteristics. Planform characteristics largely have been defined using non-standardized metrics describing individual network components, such as link lengths, braiding intensity and bifurcation angles, which often fail to separate visually-different networks of channels. We find that existing typologies remain pragmatically utilitarian rather than fundamentally physics-based and too often fail to discriminate between two distinctive and important processes integral to new channel initiation and flow-splitting: (i) in-channel bar accretion, and (ii) channel avulsion and floodplain excision. It is suggested that, first, if channel planform is to remain central to river typologies, then more rigorous quantitative approaches to the analysis of extended integral channel networks at extended reach scales (rather than network components) are required to correctly determine whether 'visually-different' channel patterns can be discriminated consistently; and, second, if such visually-different styles do in fact differ in their governing processes of formation and maintenance. A significant question is why do so many seemingly equilibrium network geometries possess a large number of anabranches in excess of predictions from theoretical considerations? The key research frontier with respect to initiating and maintaining multichannel networks remains the understanding and discrimination of accretionary-bar flow splitting versus avulsive processes. Existing and new knowledge on flow splitting processes needs to be better integrated into channel typologies. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite the occurrence of riffle–pool sequences in many rivers there are few data concerning riffle–pool unit morphology. Of many criteria proposed to identify riffle–pool units, only three methods can be regarded as objective and robust. These are the ‘zero-crossing', the ‘spectral analysis' and the ‘control-point' methods. In this paper statistics are developed using the first two of these methods to describe the streamwise morphology of 275 riffles and 285 pools which form a continuous 32{\textperiodcentered}1 km reach of the bed of the River Severn in Shropshire, England. Yalin's theoretical relationship between the average riffle:pool unit length ($\lambda$p) and channel width (W), $\lambda$p = 3W, applies to the River Severn. Reach-average riffle height (H) is a constant proportion of bankfull depth (h); typically H ≅ 0{\textperiodcentered}16h. Riffle height is a positive function of riffle length. Pool depth is a positive function of pool length. However, both riffle length and pool length increase more rapidly than the bed-level amplitude, such that long riffles or pools are relatively ‘flat'. As channel gradient reduces, bedforms flatten and become more asymmetric as riffle stoss sides and the proximal slope of pools lengthen at the expense of riffle lee sides and pool distal slopes. The statistical relationships between riffle steepness (H/L) and water depth are similar to those for equilibrium subaqueous dunes. The Severn data are consistent with Yalin's theoretical analysis relating riffle bedform length (Lr) to water depth, i.e. Lr = $\alpha$2$\pi$ h, wherein $\alpha$ ≅ 1 for steep near-equilibrium bedforms but $\alpha$ ≅ 2 to 3 as the relative depth decreases and riffles become long, low features. Theoretical consideration and turbulence data indicate that the frequency of coherent turbulent-flow structures associated with the riffle–pool mixing length in the Severn should be of the order of 50 to 100 s. The morphological similarity of the steepest River Severn riffles with dunes raises intriguing questions with respect to self-similar, convergent organization of periodic alluvial bedforms and to bedform dynamic classification particularly.

Subsequently this restriction is relaxed and the effect of varying parameter combinations within realistic limits is explored. The purpose of this exercise is to isolate those scenarios which may preclude or promote the occurrence of a competence ‘reversal', such that pools scour at high flow whilst deposition occurs on riffles.It is concluded that rivers in which pools are hydraulically rougher than riffles are likely to demonstrate a competence reversal. For prescribed conditions, the critical discharge at which a reversal occurs is a negative function of riffle spacing and riffle width relative to pool width.

abstract = {Aquatic organism passage barriers have been identified as one of the key impediments to recovery of salmonids and other migratory aquatic organisms in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. As such, state and federal agencies invest millions of dollars annually to address passage barriers. Because many barriers function as ad hoc grade control structures, their removal and/or replacement can unwittingly set off a cascade of effects that can negatively impact the very habitat and passage that project proponents seek to improve. The resultant vertical instability can result in a suite of effects that range from floodplain disconnection and loss of backwater and side channel habitat, to increased levels of turbidity. Risk assessment, including an evaluation of both the stage of stream evolution and a longitudinal profile analysis, provides a framework for determining if grade control is warranted, and if so, what type of structure is most geomorphically appropriate. Potential structures include placement of large wood and roughness elements, and constructed riffles, step-pools, and cascades. The use of structure types that mimic natural reach scale geomorphic analogues should result in improved aquatic organism passage, increased structural resilience, and reduced maintenance.},

abstract = {Rhythmic sequences of steps and pools in steep mountain streams have captured the attention of numerous workers, but whether periodicities exist in the occurrence of step-pools has not been investigated in a comprehensive way, and the implications for such periodicities have not been explored. Spectral analysis was applied to bed elevation data from streams in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California to investigate periodicity in the occurrence of step-pools. Results indicate significant step-pool periodicities, confirmed by independent field measurements, that vary from 0.43 channel widths to 2.40 channel widths. Spectral analysis of channels affected by external influences tends to indicate multiple significant peaks that reflect higher variance in step-pool spacing. Underlying periodicities are nevertheless detected, suggesting that external factors obscure but do not destroy the effects of more general internal mechanisms.Periodicity in the occurrence of step-pools suggests that step-pools are bedforms that represent a fundamental mutual adjustment between flow, channel morphology, and energy expenditure. A rhythmic channel thalweg supports the notion that step-pools are analogous to meandering in the vertical dimension, and implies that, because step-pool channels are not able to adjust energy expenditure in the plane dimension, they instead adjust boundary roughness in the vertical dimension. A continuum of rhythmic gravel bedforms that displays the results of such adjustments, and that shows how step-pools merge into pools and riffles in the stream channel system, is discussed and illustrated with empirical data from the Santa Monica Mountains. Although many differences exist between steep mountain streams and broad alluvial rivers, the findings of this study suggest that generalized principles of uniform energy expenditure may also apply to rhythmic step-pool streams. These findings are potentially valuable in the management and design of steep channels.},

abstract = {The morphology of an alluvial river channel affects the movement of water and sediment along it, but in the longer run is shaped by those processes. This interplay has mostly been investigated empirically within the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics. In rivers, this has created an emphasis on equilibrium configurations with simple morphology and uniform steady flow. But transient adjustment, whether between equilibrium states or indefinitely, is to be expected in a world in which hydrology, sediment supply, and base level are not fixed. More fundamentally, water flows and all the phenomena that accompany them are inherently unsteady, and flows in natural channels are characteristically nonuniform. The morphodynamics of alluvial river channels is the striking consequence. In this paper, we develop the essential connection between the episodic nature of bed material transport and the production of river morphology, emphasizing the fundamental problems of sediment transport, the role of bar evolution in determining channel form, the role of riparian vegetation, and the wide range of time scales for change. As the key integrative exercise, we emphasize the importance of physics-based modeling of morphodynamics. We note consequences that can be of benefit to society if properly understood. These include the possibility to better be able to model how varying flows drive morphodynamic change, to understand the influence of the sediments themselves on morphodynamics, and to recognize the inherent necessity for rivers that transport bed material to deform laterally. We acknowledge pioneering contributions in WRR and elsewhere that have introduced some of these themes.},

Morphological style is determined chiefly by the caliber and quantity of sediment delivered to the channel, although modulated by channel scale. Yet the relations between sediment transport and river morphology have received only limited, qualitative attention. In this review, the problem is studied by defining sediment transport regimes on the basis of the Shields number, a nondimensional measure of the capacity of the channel to move sediment of a given caliber. The problem is also approached from an inverse perspective by which the quantity and character of sediment deposits are used to infer details about the variation of sediment transport and sedimentation along a channel. Coupling the two approaches establishes a basis to gain new insights into the origins of alluvial channel morphology.},

abstract = {Adequate description of hydraulic variables based on a sample of field measurements is challenging in coarse-bed streams, a consequence of high spatial heterogeneity in flow properties that arises due to the complexity of channel boundary. By applying a resampling procedure based on bootstrapping to an extensive field data set, we have estimated sampling variability and its relationship with sample size in relation to two common methods of representing flow characteristics, spatially averaged velocity profiles and fitted probability distributions. The coefficient of variation in bed shear stress and roughness length estimated from spatially averaged velocity profiles and in shape and scale parameters of gamma distribution fitted to local values of bed shear stress, velocity, and depth was high, reaching 15–20{\%} of the parameter value even at the sample size of 100 (sampling density 1 m−2). We illustrated implications of these findings with two examples. First, sensitivity analysis of a 2-D hydrodynamic model to changes in roughness length parameter showed that the sampling variability range observed in our resampling procedure resulted in substantially different frequency distributions and spatial patterns of modeled hydraulic variables. Second, using a bedload formula, we showed that propagation of uncertainty in the parameters of a gamma distribution used to model bed shear stress led to the coefficient of variation in predicted transport rates exceeding 50{\%}. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of reporting the precision of estimated hydraulic parameters. When such estimates serve as input into models, uncertainty propagation should be explicitly accounted for by running ensemble simulations.},

Furthermore, their presence in conglomerates of unknown origin offers evidence of unidirectional transport and excludes beach deposits.

The purpose of this paper is to clarify several aspects of the sedimentology of riffle-pool sequences, and to suggest how these both reflect and control riffle-pool stability in the presence of spatial differences in the turbulent near-bed flow field. High-frequency velocity measurements obtained using an array of electromagnetic current meters, are combined with results from grid and transect sampling of bed sediments from 9 sites on 3 small upland rivers in N. Exmoor, U.K. Riffle sediments are shown to possess greater development of microtopographic structuring than adjacent pools, which enhances riffle stability, and which may reflect greater turbulent kinetic energy there over most of the flow range. Data on surface sediment arrangement and turbulent flow characteristics can be combined with different transport threshold equations to explain the maintenance of riffle-pool sequences with respect to a particle queuing (‘kinematic wave') model, without recourse to a competence reversal, as conventionally assumed.},

abstract = {Riffle—pool sequences are the characteristic reach-scale bedforms of mixed- and gravel-bedded rivers. While most research has been directed to the quantitative description of these sequences and to their maintenance, comparatively little attention has been given to the processes responsible for their formation. In this paper, field results from quasi-continuous velocity records obtained with an array of electro-magnetic current meters are analysed with respect to a model of macro-scale structure in the turbulent velocity field of natural channels. This model has been suggested as the most plausible basis for riffle—pool formation. The results demonstrate the occurrence of a variety of coherent flow structures, some of which scale on channel dimensions as predicted by the model, but which also suggest that some revision of the association between flow structure and riffle—pool formation is necessary. It is suggested that riffle—pool units are initiated with the generation of roller eddies upstream and downstream from a major flow obstacle corresponding to engineering criteria for scour around bridge piers. The obstacle persists long enough to fix the flow pattern and hence account for significant modification of channel form, but is ultimately removed as part of the process of bed modification via the extension of scour. Three distinct stages in the process are involved: local scour of a single pool creates deposition downstream, which then generates the next-downstream flow irregularity. A riffle—pool sequence is thus created autogenetically as the summation of a sequence of irregularities, each unit of which is formed and maintained only by flow dynamics operating at the local scale. The process is essentially both deterministic and statistical in character. It is further suggested that spatial differences in the near-bed turbulence field arising from incipient riffle—pool topography themselves create differences in surface sediment entrainment which enhance and maintain the sequence in a form process feedback mechanism. Similar reasoning might possibly be extended to the entire range of bedform sizes.},

In principle, the combined effects of abrasion and shorting can be explained if attention is paid to the role and characteristics of near-bed turbulence, via the mechanisms of abrasion in place' and the size-dependent particle acceptance or rejection involved in Bluck's turbulence template'. Field data describing spatially- and stage-dependent differences in turbulence characteristics by which the significance of such processes can be quantified are, however, lacking. In this paper, high-frequency three-dimensional velocity data obtained with an ultrasonic current meter in a braided section of Langden Brook, Lancashire, are used to demonstrate significant variations in turbulence parameters at the bar-pool scale. These are related to grain abrasion, sorting and the arrangement of grains in surface microtopographic bedforms using a force-balance model which incorporates turbulent velocity components in two dimensions. Following Bluck, it is suggested that bar forms act as, and result from, sediment trapping phenomena, whose fundamental controls lie in the characteristics of turbulence at the bar surface. Variations in turbulence provide a physical rationale for differing values of sorting/abrasion coefficients used in descriptive models of longitudinal size contrasts. In contrast to single-thread channels, however, spatially- and stage-dependent variation in turbulence characteristics is more marked in braided environments. Consequently, greater research effort is required to fully incorporate this into a spatially-realized form-process feedback mechanism applicable at the reach-scale and beyond.},

These problems can be overcome by employing the grid-by-number sampling technique. Criteria for obtaining an unbiased grid composite sample as well as its overall accuracy are provided. It is proposed that local variations in a river reach's grain-size distribution can be located by comparing the arithmetic means of adjacent subsamples through the use of statistical hypothesis testing.

abstract = {Many dams have been removed in the recent decades in the U.S. for reasons including economics, safety, and ecological rehabilitation. More dams are under consideration for removal; some of them are medium to large-sized dams filled with millions of cubic meters of sediment. Reaching a decision to remove a dam and deciding as how the dam should be removed, however, are usually not easy, especially for medium to large-sized dams. One of the major reasons for the difficulty in decision-making is the lack of understanding of the consequences of the release of reservoir sediment downstream, or alternatively the large expense if the sediment is to be removed by dredging. This paper summarizes the Dam Removal Express Assessment Models (DREAM) developed at Stillwater Sciences, Berkeley, California for simulation of sediment transport following dam removal. There are two models in the package: DREAM-1 simulates sediment transport following the removal of a dam behind which the reservoir deposit is composed primarily of non-cohesive sand and silt, and DREAM-2 simulates sediment transport following the removal of a dam behind which the upper layer of the reservoir deposit is composed primarily of gravel. Both models are one-dimensional and simulate cross-sectionally and reach averaged sediment aggradation and degradation following dam removal. DREAM-1 is validated with a set of laboratory experiments; its reservoir erosion module is applied to the Lake Mills drawdown experiment. DREAM-2 is validated with the field data for a natural landslide. Sensitivity tests are conducted with a series of sample runs in the companion paper, Cui et al. (2006), to validate some of the assumptions in the model and to provide guidance in field data collection in actual dam removal projects.},

Such regimes are readily seen in published data for modern alluvial rivers by way of a conventional Shields plot or a plot of channel slope as a function of relative grain size d/h and the ratio ws/u, where d and ws are, respectively, mean diameter and fall speed of bed sediments, and h and u, are, respectively, mean depth and friction velocity of the flow.

The model over predicts slope changes and under predicts average bed surface grain size changes because it does not account for patch dynamics. Field studies reported here using painted rocks as tracers show that fine patches and coarse patches may initiate transport at the same stage, but that much greater transport occurs in the finer patches. A theory for patch development should include grain interactions (similar size grains stop-ping each other, fine ones mobilizing coarse particles), effects of boundary shear stress divergence, and sort-ing due to cross-stream sloping bed surfaces.},

abstract = {Motion pictures taken at Duck Creek, a clear stream 6.5 m wide and 35 cm deep near Yinedale, Wyoming, provide detailed, quantitative information on both the modes of motion of individual bedload particles and the collective motions of large numbers of them. Bed shear stress was approximately 6 Pa (60 dyncs cm-2), which was about twice the threshold for movement of the 4 mm median diameter fine gravel bed material ; and transport was almost entirely as bedload. The displacements of individual particles occurred mainly by rolling of the majority of the particles and saltation of the smallest ones, and rarely by brief sliding of large, angular ones. Entrainment was principally by rollover of the larger particles and liftoff of the smaller ones, and infrequently by ejection caused by impacts, whereas distrainment was primarily by diminution of fluid forces in the case of rolling particles and by collisions with larger bed particles in the case of saltating ones. The displacement times averaged about 0.2-0.4 s and generally were much shorter than the intervening rcpose times. The collective motions of the particles were characterized by frequent, brief, localized, random sweep- transport events of very high rates of entrainment and transport, which in the aggregate transported approximately 70?4 of the total load moved. These events occurred 9 YO of the time at any particular point of the bed, lasted 1-2 s, affected areas typically 20--50 cm long by 10-20 cm wide, and involved bedload concentrations approximately 10 times greater than background. The distances travelled during displacements averaged about 15 times the particle diameter. Despite the differences in their dominant modes of movement, the 8- 16 mm particles typically travelled only about 30{\%} slower during displacement than the 2 4 mm ones, whose speeds averaged 21 cm s-'. Particles starting from the same point not only moved intermittently downstream but also dispersed both longitudinally and transversely, with diffusivities of 4.6 and 0.26 em's-', respectively. The bedload transport rates measured from the films were consistent with those determined conventionally with a bedload sampler. The 2-4 mm particles were entrained 6 times faster on finer areas of the bed, where 8-16 mm particles covered 6 {\%} of the surface area, than on coarser ones, where they covered 12 YOe, ven though 2 4 and 4-8 mm particles covered practically the same percentage areas in both cases. The 4-8 and 8-16 mm particles, in contrast, were cntrsined at the same rates in both cases. To within the statistical uncertainty, the rates of distrainment balanced the rates of entrainment for all three sizes, and were approximately proportional to the corresponding concentrations of bedload.},

abstract = {{\{}ABSTRACT{\}} Managing river bar formation in alluvial channels remains a challenging issue related to the need to free intakes, improve navigation and optimise river restoration works. This work studies the effects of locally varying the channel width on bar formation to see whether channel widening and narrowing could be feasible bar control measures. The investigation focuses on steady (hybrid) bars, the most common type of bars in lowland rivers. Several numerical experiments are performed using a two-dimensional physics-based finite-difference code. Model simplifications include capacity-limited sediment transport, uniform grain size and constant discharge. Previous tests on field and experimental data show that the simulations of the relevant processes are realistic. The results indicate that the formation of steady alternate bars downstream of lateral structures occurs at a distance that depends on the local width reduction and that narrowing the channel for a distance of 10 times the original width appears sufficient to locally suppress alternate bars. A symmetric inflow forces the formation of symmetric bed topography, as for instance a flat bed or central bars. Similarly, an asymmetric inflow forces asymmetric bed topography, as alternate bars. Upstream flow asymmetries disrupt the symmetry of central bars leading to a compound bed configuration characterised by a dominant wandering channel, a common feature in wide lowland rivers. Central and alternate bars are found to coexist even if bar stability theories predict the development of alternate bars only. These results are promising and raise fundamental questions, but need experimental and field confirmation. },

abstract = {The Ikeda, Parker, and Sawai river meandering model is reexamined using a physical approach employing an explicit equation of motion. For periodic river shapes as seen from above, a cross-stream surface elevation gradient creates a velocity shear that is responsible for the decay of small-wavelength meander bends, whereas secondary currents in the plane perpendicular to the downstream direction are responsible for the growth of large-wavelength bends. A decay length D=H/2Cf involving the river depth H and the friction coefficient Cf sets the scale for meandering, giving the downstream distance required for the fluid velocity profile to recover from changes in the channel curvature. Using this length scale and a time scale T, we explicitly trace the observed length scale invariance to the equations of motion, and predict similar time and velocity scale invariances. A general time-dependent nonlinear modal analysis for periodic rivers reveals that modes higher than the third mode are needed to describe upstream migration of bend apexes just before oxbow cutoff, and are important to accurate calculations of the time and sinuosity at cutoff.},

abstract = {In this paper the effects of boulder concentration on hydrodynamics and local and reach-averaged sediment transport properties with a flow over submerged boulder arrays are investigated. Four numerical simulations are performed in which the boulders' streamwise spacings are varied. Statistics of near-bed velocity, Reynolds shear stresses, and turbulent events are collected and used to predict bed load transport rates. The results demonstrate that the presence of boulders at various interboulder spacings altered the flow field in their vicinity causing (1) flow deceleration, wake formation, and vortex shedding; (2) enhanced outward and inward interaction turbulence events downstream of the boulders; and (3) a redistribution of the local bed shear stress around the boulder consisting of pockets of high and low bed shear stresses. The spatial variety of the predicted bed load transport rate qs based on local bed shear stress is visualized and is shown to depend greatly on the boulder concentration. Quantitative bed load transport calculations demonstrate that the reach-averaged bed load transport rate may be overestimated by up to 25 times when including the form-drag-generated shear stress of the immobile boulders in the chosen bed load formula. Further, the reach-averaged bed load transport rate may be underestimated by 11{\%} if the local variability of the bed shear stress is not accounted for. Finally, it is shown that for the small-spaced boulder array, the bed load transport rates should no longer be predicted using a normal distribution with standard deviation of the shear stress distribution $\sigma$.},

abstract = {Longitudinal profiles of alluvial rivers usually exhibit upward-concave curvatures at equilibrium. River profile concavity has been primarily attributed to sediment downstream fining and to streamwise increments of water discharge. Conversely, upward-convex profiles have been typically associated with tectonic and geologic controls and with outlet base-level drops. Equations to describe river profiles at equilibrium developed from mass conservation principles do not consider longitudinal changes in channel width. This study addresses how variations in channel width can also act to control the curvature of longitudinal profiles. We develop a new theoretical framework in which the role on river profiles of downstream variations of channel width, flow discharge, bed roughness, and surface texture are explicitly shown. Unlike classical approaches for river profile evolution, this novel framework identifies physical domains for rivers to develop upward-concave/convex longitudinal profiles depending on channel width and flow discharge gradients flow intensity and surface texture.},

abstract = {Bank erosion is integral to the functioning of river ecosystems. It is a geomorphic process that promotes riparian vegetation succession and creates dynamic habitats crucial for aquatic and riparian plants and animals. River managers and policymakers, however, generally regard bank erosion as a process to be halted or minimized in order to create landscape and economic stability. Here, we recognize bank erosion as a desirable attribute of rivers. Recent advances in our understanding of bank erosion processes and of associated ecological functions, as well as of the effects and failure of channel bank infrastructure for erosion control, suggest that alternatives to current management approaches are greatly needed. In this article, we develop a conceptual framework for alternatives that address bank erosion issues. The alternatives conserve riparian linkages at appropriate temporal and spatial scales, consider integral relationships between physical bank processes and ecological functions, and avoid secondary and cumulative effects that lead to the progressive channelization of rivers. By linking geomorphologic processes with ecological functions, we address the significance of channel bank erosion in sustainable river and watershed management.},

abstract = {Large-scale eddies are turbulent features of open channels that advect along the direction of the mean flow in a streamwise rolling motion and comprise the entire flow depth. In order to advance the understanding of large-scale eddies, it is increasingly important to make measurements on a large scale test section or in a river reach. The objective of this research was to measure characteristics of large-scale eddies using large scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) for the first time. A gravel-bed flume was chosen in order that the LSPIV technology could be applied for an environment where the eddies were known to exist. LSPIV was used to make free-surface velocity measurements in the flume for quasi-steady, uniform flow. After removing erroneous LSPIV measurements due to light reflections and inadequate seed concentrations, turbulence decomposition via the triple decomposition theorem was used to isolate the large-scale eddies from the small-scale bursting derived eddies. Visual inspection of the decomposed data, coupled with quantitative analyses of the statistical moments of the decomposed velocity and evaluation of the velocity spectrum, were used to objectively choose a decomposition time-step. The decomposed data was visualized and characteristics of the large-scale eddies were measured. LSPIV data showed that the eddy length of the large-scale eddies was approximately 4H4H, agreeing with past research. The large-scale eddies were not fully organized within the flow. The eddies propagated downstream as long-lived stable structures throughout the test section. Future research of the large-scale eddies is needed under a wide range of conditions, and LSPIV is expected to help serve this need in both large scale laboratory investigations and in the field under a range of bed conditions and flow conditions.},

@article{Fraccarollo2007,
abstract = {The behavior of liquid-granular flows, driven by gravity, is experimentally analyzed. Two types of free-surface uniform flow can take place, having different boundary conditions at the bottom. The first one runs over a fixed surface behaving as a solid (non-deformable) impermeable wall; the second one runs over a mobile-bed at rest, formed by the same loose grains and liquid of the flowing mixture. In the paper we will mark the differences between the two, but focus on the latter one. The experiments span over, and characterize, the possible flow regimes. In mobile-bed uniform flows it has been found that the Froude number reduces as the slope increases. Accordingly, there is an increment of the solid-concentration. These results are meaning that as slope increases a progressive dominance and thickening of frictional layers over collisional ones is taking place through the flow depth. Same behaviours have been observed by changing the type of grains in the flowing mixture. These findings contrast with the case of flows over a solid wall, where different trends are observed. Application of force balances by means of Coulomb law provides interesting confirmation of what observed and allows to take into account the surface-tension effects, which come into play when the particles on top are going to desaturate. Experimental data have also been employed to assess the applicability of kinetic theories to wet granular flows. Energy and momentum balances, under the hypothesis of no contribution in the liquid phase (except for the added mass concept) to shear stress and to the energy processes, are applied throughout the flow depth of the solid phase. Although depth-averaged quantities come out to have a trend similar to the experimental one, deficiencies in the theoretical approach, mainly due to its inability to represent frictional contacts, are clearly detected. Same conclusions may be drawn by applying the quite simple Bagnold theory. Altogether, a more appropriate theory able to deal with both collisional and frictional mechanisms, including the transition between, is demanded.},

abstract = {A scaling analysis of the depth-integrated momentum equations tailored to the rough bed conditions of mountain streams suggests that certain velocity correlation terms that arise from depth integration, and which normally can be neglected in the case of smoother alluvial channels, can be a significant part of the momentum balance in these steep channels. By introducing the kinetic energy equation of the time-averaged motion to treat these correlation terms, which involve products of local deviations in velocity components about depth-averaged values, a flow model that suitably characterizes streamwise accelerations is obtained. A linear stability analysis using a flow model that retains the streamwise correlation terms suggests that their effect is to strengthen the initial selection of bed form wavelengths, as reflected by sharpened peaks in curves of growth rate versus bed form wavelength. Wavelengths with zero migration rate are close to wavelengths having the largest growth rate; thus selection of fixed bars is strong. Critical width-depth ratios necessary for bed form growth are significantly less than the critical ratios that are predicted when correlation terms are neglected. Moreover, a broader band of wavenumbers can be activated at a given width-depth ratio, and bed form modes representing midchannel bars can be activated in a narrower channel than would otherwise be predicted. Thus alternate bars can initially “compete” with midchannel bars, particularly at low sediment transport rates. This competition probably contributes to the complexity of bed topography that is typical of rough, mountain channels.},

abstract = {The ideas of advection and diffusion of sediment particles are probabilistic constructs that emerge when the Master equation, a precise, probabilistic description of particle conservation, is approximated as a Fokker–Planck equation. The diffusive term approximates nonlocal transport. It ‘looks' upstream and downstream for variations in particle activity and velocities, whose effects modify the advective term. High-resolution measurements of bedload particle motions indicate that the mean squared displacement of tracer particles, when treated as a virtual plume, primarily reflects a nonlinear increase in the variance in hop distances with increasing travel time, manifest as apparent anomalous diffusion. In contrast, an ensemble calculation of the mean squared displacement involving paired coordinate positions independent of starting time indicates a transition from correlated random walks to normal (Fickian) diffusion. This normal behavior also is reflected in the particle velocity autocorrelation function. Spatial variations in particle entrainment produce a flux from sites of high entrainment toward sites of low entrainment. In the case of rain splash transport, this leads to topographic roughening, where differential rain splash beneath the canopy of a desert shrub contributes to the growth of a soil mound beneath the shrub.With uniform entrainment, rain splash transport, often described as a diffusive process, actually represents an advective particle flux that is proportional to the land surface slope. Particle diffusion during both bedload and rain splash transport involves motions that mostly are patchy, intermittent and rarefied. The probabilistic framework of the Master equation reveals that continuous formulations of the flux and its divergence (the Exner equation) rep- resent statistically expected behavior, analogous to Reynolds-averaged conditions. Key topics meriting clarification include the mechanical basis of particle diffusion, effects of rarefied conditions involving patchy, intermittent motions, and effects of rest times on diffusion of tracer particles and particle-borne substances.},

abstract = {Summary The entrainment forms of the bed load sediment flux and the Exner equation provide a probabilistic framework for examining details of sediment particle motions and transport. The central elements of these forms involve the particle entrainment rate and the joint probability distribution of particle hop distances and associated travel times measured start‐to‐stop. When expressed in integral (convolution) form, the Exner equation may be viewed as a Master equation that is both ‘nonlocal' and scale independent. If the joint distribution of hop distances and travel times has finite moments, this integral form can be approximated as a Fokker‐Planck‐like equation possessing advective and diffusive parts. The diffusive term is an approximation of the nonlocal behavior embodied in the integral form of the Exner equation, and, in effect, modulates the advective term. Theory and measurements based on high‐speed imaging of coarse sand transported as bed load suggest that the relationship between particle hop distances L x and travel times T p has the form L x = aT P 2 + $\epsilon$, where a is a characteristic acceleration and $\epsilon$ is a stochastic deviation about the expected hop distance L x . An exponential distribution of travel times T p and a Weibull distribution of hop distances L x with shape parameter k {\textless} 1 reflect internal consistency concerning expected particle behavior. The probabilistic formulation leads to the idea that the Exner equation, written in continuous form, represents statistically expected behavior, analogous to the interpretation of Reynolds‐averaged quantities in the study of turbulent flows.},

abstract = {A linear stability analysis using a flow model appropriate for steep, rough channels suggests that initial wavelength selection of alternate bars is strong for extant flow conditions in North Boulder Creek, Colorado. This is due in part to effects of velocity correlation terms in the streamwise momentum balance that involve deviations in velocity components about depth-averaged values. The analysis also suggests that alternate bars and midchannel bars can “compete” during initial bed form growth at low sediment transport rates. These points are consistent with the observation that alternate and midchannel bar forms in North Boulder Creek have comparable topographic relief, as revealed by spectral analysis of the bed topography. Moreover, the dominant wavelengths of these bar forms match the fastest growing wavelengths predicted by the stability analysis. However, whereas the alternate bar topography can be attributed to free-bar growth, much of the midchannel bar topography probably is a forced-bar topography that is related to flow accelerations associated with variations in channel width. The complex bed topography of North Boulder Creek thus consists of a decipherable mixture of bed forms that have evolved as free alternate bars together with forced bars whose positions and geometries are fixed in relation to variations in channel width or to large immobile boulders.},

abstract = {Using a dam removal on the Ashuelot River in southern New Hampshire, we test how a sudden, spatially non-uniform increase in river slope alters sediment transport dynamics and riparian sediment connectivity. Site conditions were characterized by detailed pre- and post-removal field surveys and high-resolution aerial lidar data, and locations of erosion and deposition were predicted through one-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling. The Homestead Dam was a {\~{}}200year old, 4m high, 50m wide crib dam that created a 9.5km long, relatively narrow reservoir. Following removal, an exhumed resistant bed feature of glaciofluvial boulders located 400m upstream and {\~{}}2.5m lower than the crest of the dam imposed a new boundary condition in the drained reservoir, acting as a grade control that maintained a backwater effect upstream. During the 15months following removal, non-uniform erosion in the former reservoir totaled {\~{}}60,000m3 (equivalent to {\~{}}9.3cm when averaged across the reservoir). Net deposition of {\~{}}10,700m3 was measured downstream of the dam, indicating most sediment from the reservoir was carried more than 8km downstream beyond the study area. The most pronounced bed erosion occurred where modeled sediment transport increased in the downstream direction, and deposition occurred both within and downstream of the former reservoir where modeled sediment transport decreased in the downstream direction. We thus demonstrate that spatial gradients in sediment transport can be used to predict locations of erosion and deposition on the stream bed. We further observed that bed incision was not a necessary condition for bank erosion in the former reservoir. In this characteristically narrow and shallow reservoir lacking abundant dam-induced sedimentation, the variable resistance of the bed and banks acted as geomorphic constraints. Overall, the response deviated from the common conceptual model of knickpoint erosion and channel widening due to dam removal. With thousands of dams likely to be considered for removal or repair in the coming decades, this study helps to advance predictions of the geomorphic response to dam removal and contributes to a broader understanding of the variability in both style and timing of fluvial responses to disturbances.},

These three key flood effects signal redistribution of sediment across landscapes, reflecting hillslope-channel coupling and the sources and/or sinks of material. We show that spatial gradients in total stream power ($\Omega$) provide critical additional information beyond at-a-point $\Omega$ magnitudes for predicting which reaches are likely to be susceptible to these hazards during floods. Field tests in four rivers (watershed areas 0.8–180 km2) indicate that downstream increases in $\Omega$ coincide with erosion and mass wasting into channels, and downstream decreases in $\Omega$ are associated with floodplain deposition. Our analytical approach, supported by field evidence, predicts geologic hazards and, more broadly, sources and sinks of material along rivers. These are critical concerns from a practical and theoretical standpoint.},

abstract = {Bedforms in gravel-bed rivers range in size from 102 to 103m and have a wide range of affects on sediment transport and channel stability. To study the affect of these bedforms on sediment transport a classification scheme is proposed that breaks the bedforms into micro, meso, macro and megaforms. Then using two creeks in British Columbia and one in California, the trend of sediment transport rates is related to the bed state, sediment and wood storage and the associated bedforms are discussed. At small spatial and temporal scales (micro/mesoform scales), variability in sediment transport rate can be ascribed to the changing state of the bed, which largely depends on the sediment supply regime. Stabilizing bedforms develop when sediment supply is low, and reduces the depth of the bed active layer and the mobility of the grains, thereby decreasing the sediment transport rate. Sediment rating relations in a low sediment supply channel are steep and are believed to be extremely sensitive to small changes in sediment supply and flow regime when compared to higher sediment supply systems. High sediment supply suppresses the development of stabilizing bedforms and increases the mobility of grains and the depth of the active layer. At the reach scale (macroform scale), high sediment mobility is shown to produce complex cycles of aggradation and degradation that can persist for decades. Inchannel woody debris can strongly influence the timing and magnitude of these aggradation–degradation cycles and also has an important effect on the development of megaforms.},

abstract = {This paper reviews sediment transport and channel morphology in small, forested streams in the Pacific Northwest region of North America to assess current knowledge of channel stability and morphology relevant to riparian management practices around small streams. Small channels are defined as ones in which morphology and hydraulics may be significantly influenced by individual clasts or wood materials in the channel. Such channels are headwater channels in close proximity to sediment sources, so they reflect a mix of hillslope and channel processes. Sediment inputs are derived directly from adjacent hillslopes and from the channel banks. Morphologically significant sediments move mainly as bed load, mainly at low intensity, and there is no standard method for measurement. The larger clastic and woody elements in the channel form persistent structures that trap significant volumes of sediment, reducing sediment transport in the short term and substantially increasing channel stability. The presence of such structures makes modeling of sediment flux in these channels — a potential substitute for measurement — difficult. Channel morphology is discussed, with some emphasis on wood related features. The problem of classifying small channels is reviewed, and it is recognized that useful classifications are purpose oriented. Reach scale and channel unit scale morphologies are categorized. A “disturbance cascade” is introduced to focus attention on sediment transfers through the slope channel system and to identify management practices that affect sediment dynamics and consequent channel morphology. Gaps in knowledge, errors, and uncertainties have been identified for future research.},

abstract = {This paper examines channel dynamics and bed load transport relations through an obstruction-forced pool in a forest, gravel-bed stream by comparing flow conditions, sediment mobility, and bed morphology among transects at the pool head, centre, and tail. Variable sediment supply from within and outside of the channel led to a complex pattern of scour and fill hysteresis. Despite the large flood magnitude, large portions of the bed did not scour. Scour was observed at three distinct locations: two of these were adjacent to large woody debris (LWD), and the third was along the flow path deflected by a major LWD obstruction. Bed material texture showed little change in size distribution of either surface or subsurface material, suggesting lack of disruption of the pre-flood bed. Fractions larger than the median size of the bed surface material were rarely mobile. Sediment rating relations were similar, although temporal variation within and among stations was relatively high. Relations between bed load size distribution and discharge were complex, showing coarsening with increasing discharge followed by fining as more sand was mobilized at high flow. Lack of local scour in the pool combined with bed load fining and net fill by relatively fine material implied that the dominant sources of mobile sediment were upstream storage sites and local bank collapse. Patterns of flow, channel dynamics, and sediment mobility were strongly affected by a LWD flow obstruction in the pool centre that created turbulent effects, thereby enhancing entrainment and transport in a manner similar to scour at bridge piers.},

abstract = {Abstract We propose a hierarchical system of classifying stream habitats based on three increasingly fine descriptions of the morphological and hydraulic properties of channel geomorphic units. We define channel geomorphic units as areas of relatively homogeneous depth and flow that are bounded by sharp gradients in both depth and flow. Differences among these units provide a natural basis for habitat classification that is independent of spatial scale. At the most general level of resolution, we divide channel units into fast- and slow-water categories that approximately correspond to the commonly used terms ?riffle? and ?pool.? Within the fast-water category, we identify two subcategories of habitats, those that are highly turbulent (falls, cascades, chutes, rapids and riffles) and those with low turbulence (sheets and runs). Slow-water habitats include pools formed by channel scour (eddy pools, trench pools, mid-channel pools, convergence pools, lateral scour pools and plunge pools) and those formed behind dams. Dammed pools include those obstructed by debris dams, beaver dams, landslides and abandoned channels. We consider back-waters as a type of dammed pool. Fishes and other stream organisms distinguish among these habitats at one or more levels of hierarchy. Habitats defined in this way represent an important habitat templet on which patterns of biological diversity and production form. We believe that a hierarchical system of classification will facilitate understanding of biotic-habitat relationships in streams and lead to more effective methods of evaluating the effects of environmental change on stream ecosystems. Refining the criteria by which habitats are distinguished, quantifying how different species use different habitats, and integrating the ways biota respond to habitat variation should facilitate the emergence of a theory of stream habitat organization.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the application of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) to determine the full population of grain roughness in gravel-bed rivers. The technique has the potential to completely replace the need for complex, time-consuming manual sampling methods. Using TLS, a total of 3.8 million data points (mean spacing 0.01 m) were retrieved from a gravel bar surface at Lambley on the River South Tyne, UK. Grain roughness was extracted through determination of twice the local standard deviation (2$\sigma$z) of all the elevations in a 0.15 m radius moving window over the data cloud. 2$\sigma$z values were then designated to each node on a 5 cm regular grid, allowing fine resolution DEMs to be produced, where the elevation is equivalent to the grain roughness height. Comparisons are made between TLS-derived grain roughness and grid-by-number sampling for eight 2 m2 patches on the bar surface. Strong relationships exist between percentiles from the population of 2$\sigma$z heights with measured a-, b-, and c-axes, with the closest matches appearing for the c-axis. Although strong relationships exist between TLS-derived grain roughness (2$\sigma$z), variations in the degree of burial, packing and imbrication, results in very different slope and intercept exponents. This highlights that conventional roughness measurement using gravel axis length should be used with caution as measured axes do not necessarily represent the actual extent to which the grain protrudes into the flow. The sampling error inherent in conventional sampling is also highlighted through undertaking Monte Carlo simulation on a population of 2000 clasts measured using the grid-by-number method and comparing this with the TLS-derived population of grain roughness heights. Underestimates of up to − 23{\%} and overestimates of up to + 50{\%} were found to occur when considering the D84, and − 20{\%} and overestimates of up to + 36{\%} were found to occur when considering the D50.},

abstract = {[1] Steep slope streams show large fluctuations of sediment discharge across several time scales. These fluctuations may be inherent to the internal dynamics of the sediment transport process. A probabilistic framework thus seems appropriate to analyze such a process. In this paper, we present an experimental study of bedload transport over a steep slope flume for small to moderate Shields numbers. The sampling technique allows the acquisition of high‐ resolution time series of the solid discharge. The resolved time scales range from 10 −1 s up to 10 5 s. We show that two distinct time scales can be observed in the probability density function for the waiting time between moving particles. We make the point that the separation of time scales is related to collective dynamics. Proper statistics of a Markov process including collective entrainment are derived. The separation of time scales is recovered theoretically for low entrainment rates. Citation: Heyman, J., F. Mettra, H. B. Ma, and C.

abstract = {This thesis addresses the problem of a statistical description of the transport of sediment as bed load. It highlights the role of fluctuations arising during the transport process, and their impact on macroscopic averages. The results presented here are based on four experimental studies. Two of them were published recently by B{\"{o}}hm et al. [2004] and Roseberry et al. [2012] while the other two were carried out during the thesis. In particular, two high speed cameras were used to automatically reconstruct particle trajectories over a window of approximately 1mlength, continuously over a few minutes. This constitutes, at the time of writing, one of the largest sets of experimental particle trajectory data available. Based on these experiments, two probabilistic models are proposed. The first one offers a macroscopic picture of the fluctuations of particle activity (concentration of moving particles). Based on a model recently proposed by Ancey et al. [2008], it allows for the accurate prediction of the fluctuations observed in the bed load flux. A new formula for the probability density function of the volume-averaged bed load flux is derived and compared to experimental data as well as to existing theory. By slightly modifying the original model, it was also possible to derive the probability density function of the inter-arrival time of particles. The latter shows an unusual bimodal shape due to the effect of collective entrainment. This phenomenon is referred to as the “separation of time scales” [Heyman et al., 2013]. Although providing an accurate picture of the macroscopic fluctuations arising in bed load transport, the first model does not gather information about the spatial behaviour of the bed load flux fluctuations. To remedy this, a new probabilistic model, able to locally describe the transport process, is proposed. This model lies in-between a kinetic description of the transport process and the macroscopic model proposed by Ancey et al. [2008]. In this regard, only the particle positions are treated as random variables, while particle velocities are assumed to be close to theMaxwellian equilibrium distribution. By a careful analysis of first and second moments, in both spatial and temporal dimensions, I prove the occurrence of large correlated structures that strongly perturb the average equilibrium, while not fundamentally modifying it. Moreover, I show that the validity of Taylor's frozen flow hypothesis for bed load transport is severely called into question by the experimental data, proving the peculiar behaviour of those structures during transport by the mean vii Remerciements fluid flow. Finally, a discussion about scales of fluctuations is provided. It follows from experimental results, as well as from theoretical predictions, that local fluctuations may play an important role in both an experimental setup and natural rivers. Indeed, the saturation and the correlation lengths are often so large that fluctuations may interact in a non-trivial way with the boundaries of the system, precluding the use of macroscopic average equations. Finally, this thesis suggests that the inherent fluctuations of bed load transport rates may need to be taken into account in numerical simulations in order to accurately describe the transport process.},

abstract = {The fraction of pool volume filled with fine sediment (usually fine sand to medium gravel) can be a useful index of the sediment supply and substrate habitat of gravel-bed channels. It can be used to evaluate and monitor channel condition and to detect and evaluate sediment sources. This fraction (V*) is the ratio of fine-sediment volume to pool water volume plus fine-sediment volume. These volumes are computed for the residual por- tion of the pool that lies below the elevation of the downstream riffle crest. Fine-sediment thickness is measured by driving a graduated metal probe into a fine-grained deposit until the underlying coarser substrate is felt. Water depth and fine- sediment thickness are measured across transects, and volumes are computed by summing products of cross-sectional areas and distances between transects. Replicate measurements of V* were made in 20 pools, and the variability of V*w, the weighted mean value of V* for a reach, was analyzed in 12 reaches. The largest source of variability in V* was the measurement of fine sediment volume. Topographic irregularities in pools and on riffle crests and effects of variation in discharge on measurement of riffle crest elevation also affected V*. Ten to 20 pools are needed to estimate V*w in a reach, depending on acceptable error and variability between pools.},

abstract = {The grain-scale morphology of fluvial sediments is an important control on the character and dynamics of river systems; however current understanding of its role is limited by the difficulties of robustly quantifying field surface morphology. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) offers a new methodology for the rapid acquisition of high-resolution and high-precision surface elevation data from in situ sediments. To date, most environmental and fluvial applications of TLS have focused on large-scale systems, capturing macroscale morphologies. Application of this new technology at scales necessary to characterize the complexity of grain-scale fluvial sediments therefore requires a robust assessment of the quality and sources of errors in close-range TLS data. This paper describes both laboratory and field experiments designed to evaluate close-range TLS for sedimentological applications and to develop protocols for data acquisition. In the former, controlled experiments comprising high-resolution scans of white, grey and black planes and a sphere were used to quantify the magnitude and source of three-dimensional (3D) point errors resulting from a combination of surface geometry, reflectivity effects and inherent instrument precision. Subsequently, a methodology for the collection and processing of grain-scale TLS data is described through an application to a coarse grained gravel system, the River Feshie (D50 32 to 63 mm). This stepwise strategy incorporates averaging repeat scans and filtering scan artefact and non-surface points using local 3D search algorithms. The sensitivity of the results to the filter parameter values are assessed by careful internal validation of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) created from the resulting point cloud data. The transferability of this methodology is assessed through application to a second river, Bury Green Brook, dominated by finer gravel (D50 18 to 33 mm). The factor limiting the resolution of DTMs created from this second dataset was found to be the relative sizes of the laser footprint and smallest grains.},

abstract = {A numerical model has been developed for the routing of gravel-sized sediment along a river channel which is free to adjust both its long profile and surface texture. Hydraulic calculations use a step-backwater approach, and sediment transport is predicted with the method of Parker (1990a), which uses a low degree of size selectivity. Exchange of sediment between the surface and subsurface is described using the modified Exner equation of Parker and Sutherland (1990). The model is applied to an idealized channel based on the highly concave Allt Dubhaig, Scotland, in which fining by particle wear is minor. The rapid downstream fining observed in this river is closely matched by model predictions after a time equivalent to {\textless}102 years under the present flow regime of the river. The evolution of the fining pattern during the model run and associated changes in sediment transport and bed aggradation are described. It is concluded that strong profile concavity can force rapid downstream fining even though bed load transport is only slightly size selective. This run of the model serves as a basis for testing of the sensitivity of downstream fining to alternative choices of parameter values and boundary conditions, which are summarized here and will be described in a subsequent paper.},

abstract = {Growing empirical evidence shows that many geomorphic systems are in transient state or out of equilibrium with respect to the external driving forces. The transient state is often related to the (dis)connectivity of the many constituent parts of geomorphic systems as a result of sediment storage along the sediment flow path from its source to the final sink. The response time of geomorphic systems to external changes is thus dependent on the residence time of sediment in various storage compartments. Here, I present a mathematical concept based on reservoir theory to model residence time of sediment using millennial scale sediment budgets. The framework sheds light on the limitation of the sediment delivery ratio, which is often used as a measure of sediment connectivity in geomorphic systems, and provides analytical information on process type, pace of sediment flux and connectivity of storage compartments along the sediment cascade. The application of the reservoir theory to geomorphic systems under agricultural land use shows that sediment delivery ratios are linked to the virtual velocity of the eroded sediment, the time since the onset of agricultural land use and the size of the studied basins. With respect to the temporal evolution of sediment storages that temporarily remove sediment from the conveyor belt, the framework aims to estimate the sediment residence time in storages, which is linked to the effective time scale of disconnectivity. Reanalysis of a long-term empirical sediment budget from Central Europe reveals that the response to agricultural land use, which started {\~{}}5000yearsBP, is mainly buffered by the long residence time of sediment on hillslopes (in the order of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}years), which results in a delayed floodplain aggradation. Furthermore, the framework was applied to paraglacial mountain systems that inherit striking evidences of Pleistocene glacial erosion and still recover from the change from glacial to interglacial conditions as a consequence of the reduced lateral and longitudinal connectivity. I show that paraglacial response times of sediment flux in mountain headwater in the Canadian Rocky Mountains range in the order of 100-400ka. The results indicate that response times at the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions are much longer than the return interval of the major glaciations, causing a transient behavior of mountain headwater basins during interglacial periods. The presented reanalysis of millennial-scale sediment budgets of agricultural and mountain geosystems provides an integrative framework to link paleo-environmental reconstructions and the connectivity of transient geomorphic system to external changes.},

In the context of river restoration projects (e.g. weir removal, addition of spawning gravel), these data are nevertheless crucial to predict the downstream propagation of the geomorphological and biological benefits (e.g. supply-transport equilibrium, morphological and substratum diversity). In our study, PIT-tag tracers were used in eight medium-sized gravel-bed rivers (Ardenne Region, Belgium) to propose a flow competence relationship based on specific stream power, on the one hand, and to determine the long-term virtual velocity of the bed material corresponding to the median diameter (D50) of the surface layer of riffles, on the other hand. After each flow event that exceeded the threshold for sediment entrainment, tagged particles were sought and located, even when they were buried in the subsurface layer. Afterwards, all of the data were used to estimate the virtual velocity of the bed material over the long-term using three approaches. Finally, the results were compared with long-term transport estimations based on iron slag dispersed by the rivers since the end of the middle ages.},

abstract = {Abstract Landscape evolution models typically parse the environment into different process domains, each with its own sediment transport law: e.g., soil creep, landslides and debris flows, and river bed-load and suspended-sediment transport. Sediment transport in all environments, however, contains many of the same physical ingredients, albeit in varying proportions: grain entrainment due to a shear force, that is a combination of fluid flow, particle-particle friction and gravity. We present a new take on the perspective originally advanced by Bagnold, that views the long profile of a hillsope-river-shelf system as a continuous gradient of decreasing granular friction dominance and increasing fluid drag dominance on transport capacity. Recent advances in understanding the behavior and regime transitions of dense granular systems suggest that the entire span of granular-to-fluid regimes may be accommodated by a single-phase rheology. This model predicts a material-flow effective friction (or viscosity) that changes with the degree of shear rate and confining pressure. We present experimental results confirming that fluid-driven sediment transport follows this same rheology, for bed and suspended load. Surprisingly, below the apparent threshold of motion we observe that sediment particles creep, in a manner characteristic of glassy systems. We argue that this mechanism is relevant for both hillslopes and rivers. We discuss the possibilities of unifying sediment transport across environments and disciplines, and the potential consequences for modeling landscape evolution.},

abstract = {Fluid-sheared granular transport sculpts landscapes and undermines infrastructure, yet predicting the onset of sediment transport remains notoriously unreliable. For almost a century, this onset has been treated as a discontinuous transition at which hydrodynamic forces overcome gravity-loaded grain-grain friction. Using a custom laminar-shear flume to image slow granular dynamics deep into the bed, here we find that the onset is instead a continuous transition from creeping to granular flow. This transition occurs inside the dense granular bed at a critical viscous number, similar to granular flows and colloidal suspensions and inconsistent with hydrodynamic frameworks. We propose a new phase diagram for sediment transport, where 'bed load' is a dense granular flow bounded by creep below and suspension above. Creep is characteristic of disordered solids and reminiscent of soil diffusion on hillslopes. Results provide new predictions for the onset and dynamics of sediment transport that challenge existing models.},

abstract = {Abstract In this study, numerical experimentation with two-dimensional hydraulic modeling of pool–riffle river topography drawing on the testbed data from the classic Keller (1971) study was used to investigate the effect of synthetically manipulating topography on the occurrence and magnitude of velocity and Shields stress reversals in a pool–riffle sequence. Reversals in velocity and shear stress have been used to explore mechanisms of pool–riffle maintenance, while Shields stress (a combined measure of transport capacity and substrate erodibility) is emerging in importance. The original site topography was modeled alongside six altered ones to evaluate the sensitivity of hydraulic reversals to subtle morphology — five incrementally wider pools and a filled pool. The Caama{\~{n}}o (2009) criterion, a simplified geometric threshold for predicting velocity reversals, was applied to each terrain to evaluate its utility. The original pool–riffle topography was just over the threshold for a velocity reversal and well over the threshold for a strong Shields stress reversal. Overall, pool widening caused a predominantly local response, with change to pool hydraulics and no change in section-averaged velocity in the riffle beyond the initial widening of 10{\%}. Filling in the pool significantly increased the magnitude of reversals, whereas expanding it eliminated the occurrence of a reversal in mean velocity, though the Shields stress reversal persisted because of strong differentiation in bed material texture. Using Shields stress as a reversal parameter enabled the quantification of pool modification effects on pool–riffle resiliency. The Caama{\~{n}}o (2009) criterion accurately predicted reversal occurrence for the altered terrains with exaggerated effects, but failed to predict the weak reversal for the original topography. Two-dimensional modeling coupled with previously accepted hydrologic, geomorphic, and engineering analyses is vital in project design and evaluation prior to construction.},

Alternate bar formation is closely associated with meandering, inferring that alternate bar formation is caused by flow induced periodic disturbances of the horizontal velocity profile. Based on these considerations a criterion has been developed which defines the upper limit of alternate bar formation, and this has been satisfactorily compared to other formation criteria and experimental data. The lower limit is given by the initiation of bedload transport. A simple relation between slope, channel width and grain size is then deduced to indicate whether for a given channel, alternate bars can develop for any discharge. This relation takes into account armoring effects. Another equation is proposed to predict the scour depth resulting from alternate bar formation.

Understanding transmission of environmental signals is crucial for predicting landscape response to climate change, and interpreting paleo-climate and tectonics from stratigraphy. Here we propose that sediment transport can act as a nonlinear filter that completely destroys (“shreds”) environmental signals. This results from ubiquitous thresholds in sediment transport systems; e.g., landsliding, bed load transport, and river avulsion. This “morphodynamic turbulence” is analogous to turbulence in fluid flows, where energy injected at one frequency is smeared across a range of scales. We show with a numerical model that external signals are shredded when their time and amplitude scales fall within the ranges of morphodynamic turbulence. As signal frequency increases, signal preservation becomes the exception rather than the rule, suggesting a critical re-examination of purported sedimentary signals of external forcing.},

abstract = {Abstract In order to study the morphological evolution of river beds composed of heterogeneous material, the interaction among the different grain sizes must be taken into account. In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties arise from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data.},

abstract = {Pools, riffles, and point bars are common bed forms in straight and meandering channels. Inflections in meandering channels correspond to riffles in straight channels. Both of these forms are shoals that are symmetrical across the channel for a short distance. Pool-riffle spacing appears to be independent of channel pattern, and as straight reaches merge with meandering reaches no change occurs in the spacing, form, or symmetry of the pools and riffles. Meandering processes which result in increasing channel length may result in the addition of new pools o t keep spacing constant. A five-stage model is proposed to explain the development of alluvial channels. The model is based upon channel morphology, channel morphometry, and qualitative conclusions based on numerous field observations.},

abstract = {The erodibility of a grain on a rough bed is controlled by, among other factors, its relative projection above the mean bed, its exposure relative to upstream grains, and its friction angle. Here we report direct measurements of friction angles, grain projection and exposure, and small-scale topographic structure on a variety of water-worked mixed-grain sediment surfaces. Using a simple analytical model of the force balance on individual grains, we calculate the distribution of critical shear stress for idealized spherical grains on the measured bed topography. The friction angle, projection, and exposure of single grain sizes vary widely from point to point within a given bed surface; the variability within a single surface often exceeds the difference between the mean values of disparate surfaces. As a result, the critical shear stress for a given grain size on a sediment surface is characterized by a probability distribution, rather than a single value. On a given bed, the crtitical shear stress distributions of different grain sizes have similar lower bounds, but above their lower tails they diverge rapidly, with smaller grains having substantially higher median critical shear stresses. Large numbers of fines, trapp.ed within pockets on the bed or shielded by upstream grains, are effectively lost to the flow. Our calculations suggest that critical shear stress, as conventionally measured, is defined by the most erodible grains, entrained during transient shear stress excursions associated with the turbulent flow; this implies a physical basis for the indeterminacy of initial motion. These observations suggest that transport rate/shear stress relationships may be controlled, in part, by the increasing numbers of grains that become available for entrainment as mean shear stress increases. They also suggest that bed textures and grain size distributions may be controlled, within the constraints of an imposed shear stress and sediment supply regime, by the influence of each size fraction on the erodibility of other grain sizes present on the bed.},

abstract = {Traditionally, rivers were downscaled to the laboratory through similarity of the Froude, Shields and Reynolds numbers. This has worked well for rivers with fixed banks and for braided gravelbed rivers. For self-formed dynamic meandering rivers in experiments, Froude scaling is incomplete without a constrained width-depth ratio. This aspect ratio should be small enough to obtain alternate bars and bank erosion should somehow be limited. Our objective was to develop a scaling and design strategy for experimental meandering that includes bank strength so that width-depth ratio, bar pattern and channel dynamics can be designed. Scale effects of water surface tension and of smooth boundaries were inferred from first principles. Bank strength cannot be predicted well and was experimentally evaluated with two fast, repeatable experimental setups for a range of sediments with additives and vegetation. With selected sediments, we produced moderately dynamic meandering rivers on a 1.25x7.5 m flume. A sediment mixture ranging from silt to fine gravel produces richer morphodynamics and less scale effects with adjustable slightly cohesive banks and self-formed floodplains. Width-depth ratio reduced and floodplain sedimentation prevented that chute cut-offs led to braiding. Different vegetation species and controlled conditions allow adjustable growth rate, bank strength and hydraulic resistance. With the appropriate theory and our preparatory experiments, a range of dynamic river patterns can now be designed for the laboratory with the essential characteristics of their natural counterparts.},

@article{Kleinhans201443,
abstract = {Abstract Laboratory experiments to simulate landscapes and stratigraphy often suffer from scale effects, because reducing length- and time scales leads to different behaviour of water and sediment. Classically, scaling proceeded from dimensional analysis of the equations of motion and sediment transport, and minor concessions, such as vertical length scale distortion, led to acceptable results. In the past decade many experiments were done that seriously violated these scaling rules, but nevertheless produced significant and insightful results that resemble the real world in quantifiable ways. Here we focus on self-formed fluvial channels and channel patterns in experiments. The objectives of this paper are 1) to identify what aspects of scaling considerations are most important for experiments that simulate morphodynamics and stratigraphy of rivers and deltas, 2) to establish a design strategy for experiments based on a combination of relaxed classical scale rules, theory of bars and meanders, and small-scale experiments focussed at specific processes. We present a number of small laboratory setups and protocols that we use to rapidly quantify erosional and depositional types of forms and dynamics that develop in the landscape experiments as a function of detailed properties, such as effective material strength, and to assess potential scale effects. Most importantly, the width-to-depth ratio of channels determines the bar pattern and meandering tendency. The strength of floodplain material determines these channel dimensions, and theory predicts that laboratory rivers should have 1.5 times larger width-to-depth ratios for the same bar pattern. We show how floodplain formation can be controlled by adding silt-sized silicaflour, bentonite, Medicago sativa (alfalfa) or Partially Hydrolyzed PolyAcrylamide (a synthetic polymer) to poorly sorted sediment. The experiments demonstrate that there is a narrow range of conditions between no mobility of bed or banks, and too much mobility. The density of vegetation and the volume proportion of silt allow well-controllable channel dimensions whereas the polymer proved difficult to control. The theory, detailed methods of quantification, and experimental setups presented here show that the rivers and deltas created in the laboratory seem to behave as natural rivers when the experimental conditions adhere to the relaxed scaling rules identified herein, and that required types of fluvio-deltaic morphodynamics can be reproduced based on conditions and sediments selected on the basis of a series of small-scale experiments.},

Spatially distributed high frequency, three-dimensional velocity measurements were recorded in situ using acoustic Doppler velocimeters at different flow stages. The spatial distributions of turbulent kinetic energy, ke, longitudinal component integral timescales, ITSu, and Reynolds shear stresses were characterized and are presented for selected sites. The longitudinal–vertical Reynolds shear stress increased with flow stage more strongly than the longitudinal–lateral or lateral–vertical Reynolds shear stresses and dominate at the highest measured flows. Canonical redundancy analysis was used to relate LRE morphometrics and mean flow conditions to the turbulence parameters estimated in the LRE wakes (i.e., ke, ITSu, and Reynolds shear stresses). LRE size and mean unobstructed velocity explained the highest proportion of the variance in the turbulent wake statistics. Multivariate regression models based on LRE width, mean unobstructed longitudinal velocity and flow depth are presented offering a tool to predict LRE wake turbulence.},

Because each PIT has its own signal identification, this technique is ideal for tracking the individual movements of episodically transported particles in gravel-bed rivers. Two hundred and four tagged particles were inserted into a 130-m-long reach of a gravel-bed river with a 2{\%} slope and a bed material with a D50 of 70 mm. The b axis size of the tagged particles ranged from 40 mm to 250 mm. Recovery percentages after two competent floods were 96{\%} and 87{\%}, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of this new technique. Buried particles can be recovered at a depth of 0.25 m. PIT tags are also suited for long-term studies over several years.},

abstract = {Data from laboratory flumes and natural streams show that the critical Shields stress for initial sediment motion increases with channel slope, which indicates that particles of the same size are more stable on steeper slopes. This observation is contrary to standard models that predict reduced stability with increasing slope due to the added downstream gravitational force. Processes that might explain this discrepancy are explored using a simple force-balance model, including increased drag from channel walls and bed morphology, variable friction angles, grain emergence, flow aeration, and changes to the local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations. Surprisingly, increased drag due to changes in bed morphology does not appear to be the cause of the slope dependency because both the magnitude and trend of the critical Shields stress are similar for flume experiments and natural streams, and significant variations in bed morphology in flumes is unlikely. Instead, grain emergence and changes in local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations seem to be responsible for the slope dependency due to the coincident increase in the ratio of bed-roughness scale to flow depth (i.e., relative roughness). A model for the local velocity within the grain-roughness layer is proposed based on a 1-D eddy viscosity with wake mixing. In addition, the magnitude of near-bed turbulent fluctuations is shown to depend on the depth-averaged flow velocity and the relative roughness. Extension of the model to mixed grain sizes indicates that the coarser fraction becomes increasingly difficult to transport on steeper slopes.},

The direction anglcs arc then sine functions of channel distancc. This yields a meander shape typically present in meandering rivers and has the characteristic that the ratio of meander length to average radius of curvature in the bend is 4.7. Depth, velocity, and slope are shown by field observations to be adjusted so as to decrease the variance of shear and the friction factor in a meander cwve over that in an otherwise comparable straight rcach of the same river. Since theory and observation indicate meandcrs achieve the minimum variance postulated, it follows that for channels in which alternating pools and riffles occur, meandering is the most probable form of channel geometry and thus is more stable geometry than a straight or nonmcaiidcring alincment .},

abstract = {The paper documents a detailed set of measurements from laboratory experiments involving open?channel flows of granular?liquid mixtures. Polyvinyl Chloride pellets mixed with clear water are used, and represent simplified analogues of the mixtures of rocks and muddy water encountered in stony inertial debris flows. The flows are examined in steady uniform conditions, achieved by setting up a closed loop with an inclined channel and a high?speed conveyor belt. Such idealized conditions make it possible to estimate stresses within the flowing mixture, and to accumulate statistics of local granular configurations and motions. These are extracted from video sequences imaged through the sidewall, using algorithms based on the Vorono{\"{i}} diagram. Estimates of granular concentration and granular temperature are derived from local grain patterns and from a detailed analysis of Lagrangian and Eulerian velocity correlations. Depth profiles of kinematic and dynamic quantities are then obtained for various ratios of solid to liquid discharges. These data were earlier used to probe depth variations of rheological behaviour in granular?liquid flows. To make them available for other purposes, they are assembled here into a comprehensive dataset, and provided in digital form in the electronic supplement to this special issue.},

In the 1960s Bagnold gave the name loose-boundary hydraulics to this field of study to distinguish it from the hitherto more common analysis of the pure fluid motion alone. Initially we can distinguish two types of sediment flow boundary: granular-cohesionless and cohesive. The first type includes all boundaries made up of discrete solid grains which are kept in contact with adjacent grains purely by gravitational effects. The second type applies most commonly to clay mineral aggregates on mud beds where the tiny clay mineral flakes are mutually attracted by electrolytic forces which may be large compared to gravitational ones (Ch. 9).},

The magnitude of $\tau$yy is estimated as about 0.3$\tau$yx. Calculations from experimental data on suspended fine sand transport over upper phase beds reveals that $\tau$yy, is in approximate equilibrium with the weight stress due to the suspended load.},

abstract = {The patterns of depth, velocity, and shear stress that direct a river's morphologic evolution are governed by a balance of forces. Analyzing these forces, associated with pressure gradients, boundary friction, channel curvature, and along- and across-stream changes in fluid momentum driven by bed topography, can yield insight regarding the establishment and maintenance of stable channel forms. This study examined how components of the local force balance changed as a meandering channel evolved from a simple, flat-bedded initial condition to a more complex bar-pool morphology. A numerical flow model, constrained by measurements of velocity and water surface elevation, characterized the flow field for four time periods bracketing two floods. For each time increment, runs were performed for discharges up to bankfull, and individual force balance components were computed from model output. Formation and growth of point bars enhanced topographic steering effects, which were of similar magnitude to the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces. Convective accelerations induced by the bar reduced the cross-stream pressure gradient, intensified flow toward the outer bank, and routed sediment around the upstream end of the bar. Adjustments in the flow field thus served to balance streamwise transport along the inner bank onto the bar and cross-stream transport into the pool. Even in the early stages of bar development, topographically driven spatial gradients in velocity played a significant role in the force balance at flows up to bankfull, altering the orientation of the shear stress and sediment transport to drive bar growth.},

abstract = {The principle that formative events, punctuated by periods of evolution, recovery or temporary periods of steady-state conditions, control the development of the step–pool morphology, has been applied to the evolution of the Rio Cordon stream bed. The Rio Cordon is a small catchment (5 km2) within the Dolomites wherein hydraulic parameters of floods and the coarse bedload are recorded. Detailed field surveys of the step–pool structures carried out before and after the September 1994 and October 1998 floods have served to illustrate the control on step–pool changes by these floods. Floods were grouped into two categories. The first includes ‘ordinary' events which are characterized by peak discharges with a return time of one to five years (1{\textperiodcentered}8–5{\textperiodcentered}15 m3 s−1) and by an hourly bedload rate not exceeding 20 m3 h−1. The second refers to ‘exceptional' events with a return time of 30–50 years. A flood of this latter type occurred on 14 September 1994, with a peak discharge of 10{\textperiodcentered}4 m3 s−1 and average hourly bedload rate of 324 m3 h−1. Step–pool features were characterized primarily by a steepness parameter c = (H/Ls)/S. The evolution of the steepness parameter was measured in the field from 1992 to 1998. The results indicate that maximum resistance conditions are gradually reached at the end of a series of ordinary flood events. During this period, bed armouring dominate the sediment transport response. However, following an extraordinary flood and unlimited sediment supply conditions, the steepness factor can suddenly decrease as a result of sediment trapped in the pools and a lengthening of step spacing. The analogy of step spacing with antidune wavelength and the main destruction and transformation mechanism of the steps are also discussed.

abstract = {Jacoby Creek (bed width = 12 m; bankfull discharge = 32.6 m3/s) contains stationary gravel bars that have forms and positions con- trolled by numerous large streamside obstructions (bedrock outcrops, large woody debris, and rooted bank projections) and bedrock bends. Bank-projection width and bar volume measured in 104 channel seg- ments 1 bed-width long are significantly cross-correlated at lags of -1, 3, and 4, indicating the tendency for large obstructions and bends to form bars 3 to 4 bed-widths downstream and 1 bed-width upstream. All of the 18 bars downstream of large obstructions or bends in the study reach were along the obstruction side of the channel or outside bank of the bend. Most of the pools (85{\%}) were next to large obstruc- tions or in bends; conversely, 92{\%} of large obstructions or bends had pools. Comparison of the volume of four bars with volumetric bar changes and volume of bedload transported during four high-flow events suggests that rates of sediment transport were sufficient to cause major changes in bars during bankfull events. The only impor- tant channel changes observed in 4 yr, however, have been associated with the movement of large woody debris and with changes in the angle at which the flow approaches an obstruction. A general model is proposed that large obstructions and non- alluvial bends stabilize the form and location of gravel bars. Bars are stabilized by two related mechanisms. 1. Large obstructions and bends cause intense, quasi-steady, secondary circulation in scour holes that terminate upstream bars at fixed locations. Obstruction width, channel deflection, scour-hole width, and bed width were measured at 26 obstructions. These data show that obstructions wider than approximately one-third of the bed form "pools" spanning the entire channel and, thus, terminating bars; smaller obstructions form "scour holes" contained within a single bar. 2. Bars are deposited upstream of large obstructions and sharp bends because of backwater reductions in stream power. Bars are deposited downstream because flow energy is expended around ob- structions and bends and because the flow expands downstream of constrictions that result from large obstructions. The formation of bars and pools inherent in many gravel chan- nels can, thus, be enhanced and fixed in position by flow structures set up around large obstructions and bends formed of resistant materials.},

abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the origin and function of armouring in gravel-bed rivers have not addressed the role of non-uniformity and unsteadiness of flow. These flow attributes have important influences on both the surface and subsurface bed material size distributions which are observed at low flow, from which we commonly make inferences concerning bedload transport at high flow. Bed armouring, measured as the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material grain size, is highly variable spatially in a channel in which past and present bed aggradation indicates that the sediment supply has exceeded the transport capacity. Alternate bar topography induces strong variations in boundary shear stress, especially at low flow. The resulting winnowing of fine sediment from zones of high stress, such as riffles, and its deposition as thin sheets in zones of low stress, such as pools, produce wide variations in armouring. Linked winnowing and deposition of fine sediment in each bar pool sequence creates pronounced, local, streamwise sorting by grain size. Streamwise sorting can lead to pronounced apparent size-selectivity in bedload transport during subsequent rising stages. The relatively fine bedload transported during initial rising stages can originate from unarmoured deposits of fines, where all particle sizes present on the bed surface may be nearly equally mobile. These surfaces are devoid of larger particles, however, that appear in the bedload only when coarser armoured surfaces become more widely entrained.},

abstract = {The study is aimed at investigating the response of the riffle–pool sequence to increased energy expenditure in the horizontal plane through meander development. It emphasizes field measurements of riffle–pool height and spacing and their links with meander morphology. River reaches in southern Ontario (Canada) were surveyed and statistical relations were established between parameters describing riffle–pool morphology (sequence length and amplitude) and planform curvature. The results indicate a lengthening of the sequence with increased total angular deflection along the measured reaches. Further analysis suggests that this lengthening occurs in the pool as a result of meander development. Apparently, as the path length extends beyond a critical threshold for a given bed material size, the transport capacity of the sequence is compromised. This may promote an initial shortening of the downstream riffle, with depositional processes ultimately forming a new riffle slightly upstream to achieve a new equilibrium.

abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between the statistics of bed load transport flux and the timescale over which it is sampled. A stochastic formulation is developed for the probability distribution function of bed load transport flux, based on the Ancey et al. (2008) theory. An analytical solution for the variance of bed load transport flux over differing sampling timescales is presented. The solution demonstrates that the timescale dependence of the variance of bed load transport flux reduces to a three-regime relation demarcated by an intermittency timescale (tI) and a memory timescale (tc). As the sampling timescale increases, this variance passes through an intermittent stage (≪tI), an invariant stage (tI {\textless} t {\textless} tc), and a memoryless stage (≫ tc). We propose a dimensionless number (Ra) to represent the relative strength of fluctuation, which provides a common ground for comparison of fluctuation strength among different experiments, as well as different sampling timescales for each experiment. Our analysis indicates that correlated motion and the discrete nature of bed load particles are responsible for this three-regime behavior. We use the data from three experiments with high temporal resolution of bed load transport flux to validate the proposed three-regime behavior. The theoretical solution for the variance agrees well with all three sets of experimental data. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the observed fluctuations of bed load transport flux over monosize/multiple-size grain beds, to the characterization of an inherent connection between short-term measurements and long-term statistics, and to the design of appropriate sampling strategies for bed load transport flux.},

abstract = {While the stabilizing function of large grains in step-pool streams has long been recognized, the role they play in gravel-bed streams is less clear. Most researchers have ignored the role of large grains in gravel bed streams, and have assumed that the median bed surface size controls the erodibility of alluvial boundaries. The experiments presented herein challenge this convention. Two experiments were conducted that demonstrate the significant morphodynamic implications of a slight change to the coarsetail of the bed material. The two distributions had the same range of particle sizes, and nearly identical bulk d50 values (1.6 mm), however the d90 of experiment GSD1 was slightly finer (3.7 mm) than that for experiment GSD2 (3.9 mm). Transport rates during GSD1 were nearly 4 times greater than during GSD2 (even though the dimensionless shear stress was slightly lower), and the channel developed a sinuous pattern with well developed riffles, pools and bars. During GSD2 the initial channel rectangular channel remained virtually unchanged for the duration of the experiment. The relative stability of GSD2 seems to be associated with a slightly larger proportion of stable (large) grains on the bed surface: at the beginning of GSD1, 3.5{\%} of the bed was immobile, while almost twice as much of it (6.1{\%}) was immobile at the beginning of GSD2. The results demonstrate that the largest grains (not the median size) exert first order control on channel stability.},

abstract = {Grade is a condition of equilibrium in streams as agents of transportation. The validity of the concept has been questioned, but it is indispensable in any genetic study of fluvial erosional features and deposits. This paper modifies and extends the theory of grade originally set forth by Gilbert and Davis.A graded stream is one in which, over a period of years, slope is delicately adjusted to provide, with available discharge and the prevailing channel characteristics, just the velocity required for transportation of all of the load supplied from above. Slope usually decreases in a downvalley direction, but because discharge, channel characteristics, and load do not vary systematically along the stream, the graded profile is not a simple mathematical curve. Corrasive power and bed rock resistance to corrasion determine the slope of the ungraded profile, but have no direct influence on the graded profile. Chiefly because of a difference in rate of downvalley decrease in caliber of load, the aggrading profile differs in form from the graded profile; the aggrading profile is, and the graded profile is not, asymptotic with respect to a horizontal line passing through base level. It is critical in any analysis of stream profiles to recognize the difference in slope-controlling factors in parts of the overall profile that are (1) graded, (2) ungraded, and (3) aggrading.A graded stream responds to a change in conditions in accordance with Le Chatelier's general law:��if a stress is brought to bear on a system in equilibrium, a reaction occurs, displacing the equilibrium in a direction that tends to absorb the effect of the stress.� Readjustment is effected primarily by appropriate modification of slope by upbuilding or downcutting, and only to a minor extent or not at all by concomitant changes in channel characteristics. Paired examples illustrate (1) the almost telegraphic rapidity with which the first phases of the reaction of a graded stream to a number of artificial changes are propagated upvalley and downvalley and, (2) the more or less complete readjustment that is effected over a period of thousands of years to analogous natural changes.The engineer is necessarily concerned chiefly with short-term and quantitative aspects of the reaction of a graded stream to changes in control, while the attention of the geologist is usually focused on the long-term and genetic aspects of the stream's response to changes. But the basic problems are the same, and a pooling of ideas and data may enable the engineer to improve his long range planning of river control measures and permit the geologist to interpret, in quantitative terms, the deposits of ancient streams.},

abstract = {Forced riffle-pools occur in gravel-bed rivers where a large nonalluvial element leads to local scour and deposition. To manage rivers where this type of morphology is found and to specify restoration measures that mimic this process, more field data on sediment mobility in forced riffle-pools is needed. The objectives of this study are to describe the spatial variability of sediment mobility and deposition in a developing forced riffle-pool and to use high-resolution flow velocity measurements to explain the observed dynamics. The field site is a forced riffle-pool in Moras Creek, a 6-m-wide gravel-bed stream with a 1.2{\%} bed slope in Quebec, Canada. Topography and the movement of sediment particles equipped with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags are surveyed through a series of competent floods. Bed shear stress is estimated from near-bed measurements of time-averaged velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. The sediment transport regime of the creek is characterized by partial mobility, exponential distributions of path lengths, and a negative relation between particle size and path length. Full mobility occurs in the center of the pool and over the exit slope where flow is accelerated from the constriction of flow during two events above the bankfull discharge. Partial mobility occurs during the same events over the entrance slope to the pool. Lateral gradients of deposition and mobility suggest that the majority of sediment in motion is routed over the side bar at the entrance to the pool. High levels of turbulence intensity that occur as a result of flow deceleration may explain the removal of finer sediments from the head of the pool.},

abstract = {A functional account of log steps in forest streams is provided by field surveys of 163 kilometers of streams in the central Oregon Coast Range. Natural treefall, rather than silvicultural activities, accounts for the majority of log steps. During low-flow conditions, dissipation of potential stream energy by log steps amounts to 6 percent, approximately equal to that by falls. There are no statistically significant differences regarding spatial distribution of log steps between study basins with contrasting silvicultural and natural stream inputs of large woody debris. However, significant spatial differences are revealed between streams of various orders, a finding that points to channel flushing capacity and stream-adjacent topography as dominant controls on log step development. Application of thermodynamic principles to stream systems demonstrates that neither falls nor log steps cause a statistically significant difference in equilibrium conditions of stream networks. The volume of sediment stored behind log steps in third-, fourth-, and fifth-order streams is 123 percent of the mean annual sediment discharge (suspended load and bed-load). Depriving some streams of log steps by stream clean-out or repeated harvest of stream-adjacent trees may initiate an episode of progressive erosion by not dissipating stream energy in excess of that needed to transport imposed sediment supplies. Addition of log steps to streams with energy already insufficient to balance sediment inputs and outputs may only serve to accentuate progressive deposition. Functions of instream large woody debris not incorporated as log steps must also be addressed in forest management decisions.},

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model contains two parameters, a and b, related to the particle feed rate and range of bed elevation fluctuations, respectively. Observations of bed evolution in flume experiments agree with model predictions; in particular, the model reproduces the asymptotic t−1 tail in the tracer waiting time exceedance probability distribution. This waiting time distribution is similar to that inferred for tracers in natural gravel streams and avalanching rice piles, indicating applicability of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting model to many disordered transport systems with tracer burial and excavation. 1.},

abstract = {Bed load sediment transport is typically formulated as a nonlinear function of the shear stress exerted on the bed in excess of a critical value. However, due to the inherent spatial variability in grain packing and protrusion on water-worked beds, the critical stress used in transport models represents a spatial averaging of the critical entrainment stresses of many individual particles on the bed. We perform a series of flume experiments in which we quantify, for the first time, the evolution of topography on the particle scale during low-flow periods. We link this topography to subsequent bed load sediment transport rates and explore implications for particle critical stresses. We exploit the observed dependence of bed load flux on antecedent low-flow duration to isolate the relationship between grain protrusion and bed load flux over a wide array of transport rates at the same applied stress. A synthesis of high-resolution bed topography surveys and bed load flux data show that bed load transport rates characteristic of gravel channels are governed by the portion of grains that protrude highest above the bed and that this portion corresponds to {\~{}}1–5{\%} of the total bed elevation distribution in our experiments. This result supports the argument that only a small portion of grain entrainment thresholds for a riverbed is exceeded during transport. Further, these results emphasize that subtle changes in bed topography can have dramatic effects on bed load sediment transport. We also find that transport of these highest protruding particles enhances the local erosion of surrounding grains.},

abstract = {The stability of ripples and dunes in flows of finite depth are investigated for the linear, small-amplitude case and also for the more realistic finite-amplitude situation. For the former perturbation approach is taken, leading to the general result that, without the inclusion of some lag between the sediment transport rate and the boundary shear stress, all wavelengths are unstable. This results from an upstream shift in the stress relative to the bedform, leading to deposition at the crest. By assuming a realistic lag based on the mechanics of bed load transport, a fastest growing wave at ripple-scales results: similarly, if suspended sediment were included, longer lags result and a dune-scale instability could result. Some investigators have invoked a gravitational effect, arguing that sediment transport is enhanced downslope and retarded upslope. This creates an effective downstream shift in the transport rate and some argue that both ripple and dune instabilities result, however, a realistic evaluation of this effect shows that it is much too small to be effective. Naturally occurring bedforms are of finite-amplitude; typically they are asymmetrical, often causing flow separation. This highly non-linear process creates a vastly different flow environment from that assumed in the initial stability case. A wake-like flow structure develops downstream of the separation zone and an internal boundary layer develops beneath. The complex interaction of these two different flow regimes as well as the effect induced by the topography of the bedform itself, produces a shear stress field that dictates the stability of the feature itself.},

abstract = {This study focuses upon flow hydraulics, sediment transport and riffle-pool maintenance on the River Rede, Northumberland, UK. Analysis of bed structure indicate pools to be coarser than riffles, suggesting these to be zones of maximum tractive force at high flow. Tractive force reversal can be demonstrated using a combination of velocity, shear stress and gravel tracer data, and is therefore advocated as a mechanism for maintaining the riffle-pool form. Three dimensional flow structures are likely to increase the likelihood of reversal in pools situated on bends, which may not always be detected using one-dimensional measures of flow hydraulics. Magnetic tracing and basket trapping techniques were used to provide an insight into rates of movement, accumulation, initial motion criteria and routing, of sand. Sand is transported selectively and is mobilised at between 11-22 Nm⁻². Deposition of sub 2mm material is prevalent on morphological high points (bars / riffle margins), although greatest quantities were routed through morphological lows. Freeze core evidence shows limited intragravel storage. Gravel tracer movements showed evidence of size selective entrainment overall, however hiding effects were also found to be evident at two scales; 30-50mm and 110-140mm (for riffles) and 20- 90mm and 11O-140mm for pool. Slope exponents for log-log relations between scaled grain size (D/D₅₀) versus dimensionless shear stress (Өc) of ≈-0.9 suggest that hiding strongly influences sediment transport. Stream power estimates from pgQs demonstrate a higher threshold for motion for gravel in pools (132 Wm⁻²) compared with riffles (127 Wm⁻²). Differences in initial motion criteria (8e) between riffles and pools were found to be significant (p{\textless}0.05), indicating pool sediments to be less mobile than riffle, despite pool sediments being less compact. Reduced mobility of pool bedload sediment results from clasts being sheltered by immobile lag gravel found in the pool. It appears therefore that mobility differences between riffles and pools, related to bed structure, does not explain riffle-pool maintenance on the Rede. Scaled travel distance (L/L₅₀s) for tracers in the reach as a whole showed a convex-up relationship with scaled grain size (D/D₅₀s), demonstrating that for tracer grains progressively coarser than the surrounding D₅₀ surface grains, travel distance drops off rapidly, whereas grains progressively finer than the surrounding clasts, travel further but at a less rapid rate. Furthermore, virtual velocity (V*) of tracer grains showed a positive dependence upon D/D₅₀s. Gravel tracer movement provided important insights into riffle-pool maintenance. Transfer of material through the Rede riffle-pool sequence appeared to be influenced by flow magnitude and duration. For low magnitude high frequency flows below 25{\%} bankfull, intra-unit movement was found to predominate. Medium magnitude and frequency flows (up to 50{\%} bankfull) appeared capable of inter-unit transport; scour from pool troughs and deposition on pool exit slopes I riffle heads, movement of material from riffles to bar edges and from bar to bar. For higher magnitude low frequency flows up to bankfull, there was less scour from pools, and a dominance of bar-to-bar sediment transfer. Limited evidence of sediment routing and deposition in pools suggest these to be scour / sediment source zones only, with supply originating from the bed and outer bank. These data demonstrate the importance of different flow magnitude and frequency in creating / maintaining different areas of the riffle-pool structure.},

abstract = {Rapids in river canyons are frequently found at sites where debris fans constrict flow along the channel. Whereas some fans may have persisted in the same location with unchanging geometry for centuries to millennia, others have changed in response to flow conditions imposed by successive floods. Such a change in boundary conditions may alter local flow hydraulics. This paper utilizes two-dimensional flow modelling to compare flood hydraulics along two alternative versions of an idealized reach of a river canyon: one with uniform width, gradient and cross-section, and a second perturbed by a prominent debris fan along the valley wall. The flow pattern along the reach with the fan is far more complex than the pattern along the uniform reach. Maximum velocity along the debris-fan reach is up to 50 per cent higher than along the uniform reach, maximum bed shear stress is up to three or four times higher, and an area of supercritical flow is predicted extending from the nose of the fan into the zone of flow expansion immediately downstream.Comparison of model output along longitudinal profiles of the two reaches indicates that the backwater effect of the fan extends several valley widths upstream. Predicted flows based on the same stage are as much as 190 to 230 per cent greater along the uniform reach than along the debris-fan reach. Reconstruction of palaeoflood discharge based on remnant flood marks in the vicinity of the fan would be sensitive to assumptions about boundary conditions that existed in the past; this effect relaxes over a longitudinal distance of several hundred metres. Furthermore there are significant cross-stream gradients that change slope and direction several times in the vicinity of the fan, calling into question the utility of one-dimensional step-backwater hydraulic models for predicting high-water marks in areas of complex valley morphology.},

abstract = {The initial instability and fully developed stability of alternate bars in straight channels are investigated using linearized and nonlinear analyses. The fundamental instability leading to these features is identified through a linear stability analysis of the equations governing the flow and sediment transport fields. This instability is explained in terms of topographically induced steering of the flow and the associated pattern of erosion and deposition on the bed. While the linear theory is useful for examining the instability mechanism, this approach is shown to yield relatively little information about well-developed alternate bars and, specifically, the linear analysis is shown to yield poor predictions of the fully developed bar wavelength. A fully nonlinear approach is presented that permits computation of the evolution of these bed features from an initial perturbation to their fully developed morphology. This analysis indicates that there is typically substantial elongation of the bar wavelength during the evolution process, a result that is consistent with observations of bar development in flumes and natural channels. The nonlinear approach demonstrates that the eventual stability of these features is a result of the interplay between topographic steering effects, secondary flow production as a result of streamline curvature, and gravitationally induced modifications of sediment fluxes over a sloping bed.},

abstract = {The beds of gravel-bed rivers commonly display distinct sorting patterns, which at length scales of ∼ 0.1 − 1 channel widths appear to form an organization of patches or facies. This paper explores alternatives to traditional visual facies mapping byinvestigating methods of patch delineation in which clustering analysis is applied to a high-resolution grid of spatial grain-size distributions (GSDs) collected during a flume experiment. Specifically, we examine four clustering techniques: 1) partitional clustering of grain-size distributions with the k-means algorithm (assigning each GSD to a type of patch based solely on its distribution characteristics), 2) spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering (“growing” patches by merging adjacent GSDs, thus generating a hierarchical structure of patchiness), 3) spectral clustering using Normalized Cuts (using the spatial distance between GSDs and the distribution characteristics to generate a matrix describing the similarity between all GSDs, and using the eigenvalues of this matrix to divide the bed into patches), and 4) fuzzy clustering with the fuzzy c-means algorithm (assigning each GSD a membership probability to every patch type). For each clustering method, we calculate metrics describing how well-separated cluster-average GSDs are and how patches are arranged in space. We use these metrics to compute optimal clustering parameters, to compare the clustering methods against each other, and to compare clustering results with patches mapped visually during the flume experiment. All clustering methods produced better-separated patch GSDs than the visually-delineated patches. Although they do not produce crisp cluster assignment, fuzzy algorithms provide useful information that can characterize the uncertainty of a location on thebed belonging to any particular type of patch, and they can be used to characterize zones of transition from one patch to another. The extent to which spatial information influences clustering leads to a trade-off between the quality of GSD separation between patch types and the spatial coherence of patches. Methods incorporating spatial information during the clustering process tended to produce a finite number of types of patches. As methods improve for collecting high-resolution grain size data, the approaches described here can be scaled up to field studies to better characterize the grain size heterogeneity of river beds.},

abstract = {Alluvial rivers respond to valley-slope deformation caused by active tectonics in various ways depending on the rate and amount of surficial deformation and on the type of river. On the basis of experimental results and field examples, hypothetical models of river response to anticlinal uplift and synclinal subsidence were developed for different types of alluvial rivers.An experimental braided channel responded to anticlinal uplift across the channel with degradation and terrace formation in the central part of the uplift. With subsidence, aggradation in the central reach was the main response. Transverse bars developed downstream of the subsidence axis. An experimental meandering channel responded to slope steepening with a sinuosity increase. Bank erosion and point-bar growth occurred downstream of the anticlinal axis and upstream of the synclinal axis. Upstream of the uplift axis and downstream of the subsidence axis, where the slope was flattened, water flooded over bars.Local convexity in longitudinal profiles of the middle Rio Grande, New Mexico, is considered to be formed by a domal uplift. Local aggradation and degradation could be explained by the effect of uplift. The San Joaquin River, California, which is now highly controlled, does not show clear adjustment to the rapid subsidence due to ground-water withdrawal. It shows, however, a channel-pattern adjustment to active tectonic subsidence that has been occurring for a long time. The San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers in Texas both increase their sinuosity significantly where monoclinal movements steepen valley slopes.},

abstract = {We study the interplay of various factors causing vertical grain-size changes in alluvial basins using a simple coupled model for sediment transport and downstream partitioning of grain sizes. The sediment-transport model is based on the linear diffusion equation; by deriving this from first principles we show that the main controls on the diffusivity are water discharge and stream type (braided or single-thread). The grain-size partitioning model is based on the assumption that the deposit is dominated by gravel until all gravel in transport has been exhausted, at which point deposition of the finer fractions begins.We then examine the response of an alluvial basin to sinusoidal variation in each of four basic governing variables: input sediment flux, subsidence rate, supplied gravel fraction, and diffusivity (controlled mainly by water flux). We find that, except in the case of variable gravel fraction, the form of the basin response depends strongly on the time-scale over which the variation occurs. There is a natural time-scale for any basin, which we call the ‘equilibrium time', defined as the square of basin length divided by the diffusivity. We define ‘slow' variations in imposed independent variables as those whose period is long compared with the equilibrium time. We find that slow variation in subsidence produces smoothly cyclic gravel-front migration, with progradation during times of low sedimentation rate, while slow variation in sediment flux produces gravel progradation during times of high sedimentation rate. Slow variation in diffusivity produces no effect. Conversely, we define ‘rapid' variations as those whose period is short compared with the equilibrium time. Our model results suggest that basins respond strongly to rapid variation in either sediment flux or diffusivity; in both cases, deep proximal unconformities are associated with abrupt gravel progradation. This progradation occurs during times of either low sediment flux or high diffusivity. On the other hand, basin response to variation in subsidence rate gradually diminishes as the time scale becomes short relative to the equilibrium time. Each of the four variables we have considered - input sediment flux, subsidence, gravel fraction, and diffusivity - is associated with a characteristic response pattern. In addition, the time scale of imposed variations relative to the equilibrium time acts in its own right as a fundamental control on the form of the basin response.},

abstract = {Methods for estimating palaeoslope from fluvial deposits have been available for some time, but new data and improved understanding of the relevant physical processes afford the possibility of improving existing methods, and the emerging field of quantitative stratigraphy provides a new context for the results. Here we focus on deriving palaeoslope estimates for coarse?grained fluvial deposits. These estimates can be used in basin analyses to constrain the magnitude of the slope change necessary for a given deflection of palaeocurrents, to constrain temporal and spatial variation in basin subsidence rate, and to provide a surface datum for use in sediment?backstripping calculations. The algorithm we derive to estimate palaeoslope applies to rivers that self?adjust through variations in channel width to maintain a temporally and spatially averaged bed shear stress equal to some constant multiple of the critical shear stress for initial motion of bed sediment. Data from modern coarse?grained rivers with minimal bank cohesion and form resistance suggest that this boundary shear stress is equal to about 1.4 times the critical shear stress for movement of the median?sized clast of the surface layer. The key sedimentological criteria for recognition of systems appropriate for this type of analysis are: (1) field relations suggesting that channel banks formed in effectively noncohesive gravel (i.e. free of clay?size sediment and plant roots); (2) absence of significant volumes of dune?derived cross?stratification; and (3) absence of indicators of extremely rapid, flash?flood?type deposition. The basic input data for a palaeoslope calculation are spatially averaged estimates of palaeodepth and median grain size. The most important aspect of data collection is that the depth and grain?size estimates should be determined independently by random sampling over the whole outcrop. Joint analysis of data from appropriate modern rivers and of errors associated with palaeodepth and grain?size estimates indicates that in coarse?grained braided?river deposits, palaeoslope can be estimated to within a factor of 2.},

abstract = {The growth of quantitative analysis and prediction in Earth-surface science has been accompanied by growth in experimental stratigraphy and geomorphology. Experimenters have grown increasingly bold in targeting landscape elements from channel reaches up to the entire erosional networks and depositional basins, often using very small facilities. The experiments produce spatial structure and kinematics that, although imperfect, compare well with natural systems despite differences of spatial scale, time scale, material properties, and number of active processes. Experiments have been particularly useful in studying a wide range of forms of self-organized (autogenic) complexity that occur in morphodynamic systems. Autogenic dynamics creates much of the spatial structure we see in the landscape and in preserved strata, and is strongly associated with sediment storage and release. The observed consistency between experimental and field systems despite large differences in governing dimensionless numbers is what we mean by “unreasonable effectiveness”. We suggest that unreasonable experimental effectiveness arises from natural scale independence. We generalize existing ideas to relate internal similarity, in which a small part of a system is similar to the larger system, to external similarity, in which a small copy of a system is similar to the larger system. We propose that internal similarity implies external similarity, though not the converse. The external similarity of landscape experiments to natural landscapes suggests that natural scale independence may be even more characteristic of morphodynamics than it is of better studied cases such as turbulence. We urge a shift in emphasis in experimental stratigraphy and geomorphology away from classical dynamical scaling and towards a quantitative understanding of the origins and limits of scale independence. Other research areas with strong growth potential in experimental surface dynamics include physical–biotic interactions, cohesive effects, stochastic processes, the interplay of structural and geomorphic self-organization, extraction of quantitative process information from landscape and stratigraphic records, and closer interaction between experimentation and theory.},

abstract = {This study uses a unique 10-year tracer dataset from a small gravel-bed stream to examine bed mobility and sediment dispersion over long timescales and at a range of spatial scales. Seasonal tracer data that captured multiple mobilizing events was examined, while the effects of morphology on bed mobility and sediment dispersion were captured at three spatial scales: within morphological units (unit scale), between morphological units (reach scale) and between reaches with different channel morphologies (channel scale). This was achieved by analyzing both reach-average mobility and travel distance data, as well as the development of ‘mobility maps' that capture the spatial variability in tracer mobility within the channel. The tracer data suggest that sediment transport in East Creek remains near critical the majority of the time, with only rare large events resulting in high mobility rates and grain travel distances large enough to move sediment past dominant bedforms. While a variable capturing both the magnitude and frequency of flow events within a season yielded a better predictor to sediment mobility and dispersion than peak discharge alone, the distribution of events of different magnitude within the season played a large role in determining tracer mobility rates and travel distances. The effects of morphology differed depending on the analysis scale, demonstrating the importance of scale, and therefore study design, when examining the effect of morphology on sediment transport.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The objective of this coupled experimental and numerical study is to provide insight into the mean and turbulent flow fields within an array of fully submerged, isolated, immobile boulders. Our study showed that the velocity defect law performed well for describing the mean flow around the boulder within the array. A prerequisite, however, was to accurately estimate the spatial variability of u* around the boulder, which was achieved via the boundary characteristics method. The u* exhibited considerable spatial variability within the array and form roughness was shown to be up to 2 times larger than the skin roughness in the boulder near-wake region. Because the boulders bear a significant amount of the flow shear, the available bed shear stress for entrainment of the mobile sediment, $\tau$ ols, near the boulders was roughly 50{\%} lower than the ambient $\tau$ ols. The $\tau$ ols variability induced by the boulders could lead to a threefold overestimation of the sediment transport rate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = { Floodwater is often extracted for consumptive purposes from western mountain streams in the United States. The long-term extraction of floodwater may alter the morphological and ecological balance of such streams. Scale model experiments based on eight mountain gravel-bed streams in Idaho were conducted to test the effects of floodwater extraction on stream morphology. The model channel transported a poorly sorted mix of model “gravel,” as well as copious amounts of model “sand.” The channel had a discontinuous floodplain, developed its own bar morphology, and contained large model colluvium as well as a bedrock platform. A mobile-bed equilibrium was first developed using a repeated hydrograph. The experiment was then repeated using a sliding cutoff discharge. The discharges in the hydrograph that were below a given cutoff discharge were reduced to 30{\%} of bankfull discharge. By raising the cutoff discharge, it was possible to study the effect of increasing severity of floodwater extraction on stream morphology. The experiments indicated an increase in sand content on the bed surface and a decrease in the standard deviation of fluctuations in bed elevation with increasing severity of floodwater extraction.},

In particular, wavelike aggradational profiles of permanent form are considered. An application to the Red Deer River, in Alberta, Canada, as well as several hypothetical cases, suggests the following result. In the case of quartzite, selective sorting controls downstream fining; in the case of limestone, abrasion and selective sorting are of roughly equal importance; and in the case of a mixture of quartz and limestone, abrasion ceases to be important beyond some characteristic length scale required to grind the gravel‐sized limestone out of existence.},

The formulation includes the possibility of differential basin uplift and subsidence due to tectonism, and mixtures of rock types with differing coefficients of abrasion. The formulation of selective sorting is based on the concept of hiding, as applied to a surface‐based bed‐load transport relation.

abstract = {An attempt has been made to describe, based solely on field data , bedload relations for natural, paved gravel-bed streams. Data gathered from Oak Creek, Oregon were used to study the size distribution of bedload in paved gravel-bed streams. Similarity analysis suggests that once the pavement is broken, essentially all sizes are rendered of roughly equal mobility. This implies that for poorly-graded gravels only one grain size is required to characterize total bedload as a function of Shields stress, and that not much extra accuracy can be gained by calculating the bedload for each size range separately and summing. It also suggests that the bedload size distribution should approximate that of the pavement. The first implication was used to develop a simple means of predicting total bedload in gravel bed streams in conjunction with data from Oak Creek, the Elbow River, and other streams. The method approximates accuracy for streams with moderate to steep slopes that are not dominated by sand throughput load. The second implication would appear to apply in terms of annual sediment yield form gravel-bed streams that are not dominated by throughput load. A reanalysis of the Oak Creek data reveals that higher flows favor coarser bedload material. As concerns the relation of Meyer-Peter and Muller, its performance regarding the field data presented in this study is poor. There also appears to be no way to adjust the relation in terms of an effective grain size to bring it into accord with the data. Thus, it is not recommended. (Baker-FRC)},

Four baseline data sets determine relations for bankfull geometry, i.e., bankfull depth, bankfull width, and down-channel slope as functions of bankfull discharge and bed surface median sediment size. These relations show a considerable degree of universality. This universality applies not only within the four sets used to determine the forms but also to three independent data sets as well. We study the physical basis for this universality in terms of four relations, the coefficients and exponents of which can be back calculated from the data: (1) a Manning-Strickler-type relation for channel resistance, (2) a channel-forming relation expressed in terms of the ratio of bankfull Shields number to critical Shields number, (3) a relation for critical Shields number as a function of dimensionless discharge, and (4) a “gravel yield” relation specifying the (estimated) gravel transport rate at bankfull flow as a function of bankfull discharge and gravel size. We use these underlying relations to explore why the dimensionless bankfull relations are only quasi-universal and to quantify the degree to which deviation from universality can be expected.

abstract = {The importance of channel non-uniformity to natural hydrogeomorphic and ecological processes in gravel-bed rivers is becoming increasingly known, but its use in channel rehabilitation lags behind. Many projects still use methods that assume steady, uniform flow and simple channel geometries. One aspect of channel non-uniformity that has not been considered much is its role in controlling backwater conditions and thus potentially influencing patterns of physical habitat and channel stability in sequences of riffles and pools. In this study, 2D hydrodynamic models of two non-uniform pool–riffle–pool configurations were used to systematically explore the effects of four different downstream water surface elevations at three different discharges (24 total simulations) on riffle–pool ecohydraulics. Downstream water surface elevations tested included backwater, uniform, accelerating, and critical conditions, which are naturally set by downstream riffle-crest morphology but may also be re-engineered artificially. Discharges included a fish-spawning low flow, summer fish-attraction flow, and a peak snowmelt pulse. It was found that the occurrence of a significant area of high-quality fish spawning habitat at low flow depends on riffles being imposed upon by backwater conditions, which also delay the onset of full bed mobility on riffles during floods. The assumption of steady, uniform flow was found to be inappropriate for gravel-bed rivers, since their non-uniformity controls spatial patterns of habitat and sediment transport. Also, model results indicated that a “reverse domino” mechanism can explain catastrophic failure and re-organization of a sequence of riffles based on the water surface elevation response to scour on downstream riffles, which then increases scour on upstream riffles.},

@article{Pelosi2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).Here we consider the 1-D morphodynamics of an erodible bed subject to bedload transport. Fluvial bed elevation variation is typically modeled by the Exner equation, which, in its classical form, expresses mass conservation in terms of the divergence of the bedload sediment flux. An entrainment form of the Exner equation can be written as an alternative description of the same bedload processes, by introducing the notions of an entrainment rate into bedload and of a particle step length, and assuming a certain probability distribution for the step length. This entrainment form implies some degree of nonlocality, which is absent from the standard flux form, so that these two expressions, which are different ways to look at same conservation principle (i.e., sediment continuity), may no longer become equivalent in cases when channel complexity and flow conditions allow for long particle saltation steps (including, but not limited to the case where particle step length has a heavy tailed distribution) or when the domain of interest is not long compared to the step length (e.g., laboratory scales, or saltation over relatively smooth surfaces). We perform a systematic analysis of the effects of the nonlocality in the entrainment form of the Exner equation on transient aggradational/degradational bed profiles by using the flux form as a benchmark. As expected, the two forms converge to the same results as the step length converges to zero, in which case nonlocality is negligible. As step length increases relative to domain length, the mode of aggradation changes from an upward-concave form to a rotational, and then eventually a downward-concave form. Corresponding behavior is found for the case of degradation. These results may explain anomalously flat, aggradational, long profiles that have been observed in some short laboratory flume experiments.},

abstract = {This paper first compiles critical shear stress values from 26 studies of gravel-bed rivers (GBRs) worldwide. The most frequently proposed value of the Shields criterion ($\theta$c) is 0.045, but three major groups with $\theta$c values ranging from {\textless}0.030 to {\textgreater}0.100 were identified. Second, dimensionless critical shear stresses (the Shields criterion) were evaluated for 14 GBRs (18 sites) with watershed areas ranging from 12 to 3000km2. Different approaches were used to identify the initial movement of the bed material: painted and PIT-tag pebbles, sediment traps, and bedload samplers. The Shields criterion ($\theta$c) was estimated using the total shear stress ($\tau$) and the grain shear stress ($\tau$'). Several shear stresses were also estimated using shear velocities. For bedload transport, we obtained an average Shields criterion ($\theta$c) of 0.040. The values were higher in small rivers ({\textgreater}0.050) than larger rivers ({\textless}0.030) because of more significant bedform shear stresses. The Shields criterion ($\theta$'c) was lower when the grain shear stress ($\tau$') was used and only reached 0.019. Different values are also proposed in relation to the type of mobilization: the $\theta$c value for partial transport was {\~{}}0.025 and exceeded 0.040 for full transport (usually reached in association with discharges with a 10-year return period). The values based on the results of sediment traps and a bedload sampler were greater than those obtained using tracers, but these differences are smaller than those usually reported in the literature.},

abstract = {[1] Sediment transport is an intrinsically stochastic process, and measurement of bed load in the environment is further complicated by the unsteady nature of river flooding. Here we present a methodology for analyzing sediment tracer data with unsteady forcing. We define a dimensionless impulse by integrating the cumulative excess shear velocity for the duration of measurement, normalized by grain size. We analyze the dispersion of a plume of cobble tracers in a very flashy stream over two years. The mean and variance of transport distance collapse onto well-defined linear and power-law relations, respectively, when plotted against cumulative dimensionless impulse. Data suggest that the asymptotic limit of bed load tracer dispersion is superdiffusive, in line with a broad class of geophysical flows exhibiting strong directional asymmetry (advection), thin-tailed step lengths and heavy-tailed waiting times. The impulse framework justifies the use of quasi-steady flow approximations for long-term river evolution modeling.},

abstract = {Large floods should seemingly influence the depth and width of rivers. Phillips and Jerolmack, however, suggest that the self-organization of bedrock river channels blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events. River channel geometries from a wide range of course-grained rivers across the United States show that larger floods have very limited additional impact on channel geometry. River channel sculpting does increase as flood size increases, but the effect is most pronounced for moderate floods. This relationship may explain the long-term stability of rivers across shifts in climate.Science, this issue p. 694Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall are hypothesized to influence landscape evolution through erosion and sediment transport by rivers. However, determining the relation between rainfall and river dynamics requires a greater understanding of the feedbacks between flooding and a river{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s capacity to transport sediment. We analyzed channel geometry and stream-flow records from 186 coarse-grained rivers across the United States. We found that channels adjust their shape so that floods slightly exceed the critical shear velocity needed to transport bed sediment, independently of climatic, tectonic, and bedrock controls. The distribution of fluid shear velocity associated with floods is universal, indicating that self-organization of near-critical channels filters the climate signal evident in discharge. This effect blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events on landscape evolution.},

@article{Phillips2011,
abstract = {Abstract Many geomorphic system states and behaviors often interpreted as tendencies toward establishment and maintenance of steady-state equilibrium are actually emergent outcomes of two simple principles: gradient selection and threshold-mediated modulation. The principle of gradient selection is simply that geomorphic features associated with gradient-driven flows persist and grow relative to other features and pathways. The principle of threshold-mediated modulation reflects the inherent limits on system development along any particular pathway. Thresholds not only define a restricted state space for any given geomorphic system, but may also result in oscillatory behavior around an intermediate condition that resembles fluctuations around a steady-state equilibrium. Together, these principles often produce outcomes that mimic steady-state equilibria. Examples are given involving several aspects of fluvial systems (channel profiles, alluvial channel changes, and drainage density), hillslope gradients, and barchan dunes. Steady-states indeed occur in Earth surface systems, and are a useful simplification in some models. However, the assumption that such states are somehow normative, or the only natural condition, is incorrect, and can lead to problems in geomorphic interpretations, environmental restoration and management, and conceptions of how Earth systems work.},

abstract = {Regression equations with the form y = f(q), where y is a channel characteristic and q is a discharge of a particular frequency are widely used in fluvial geomorphology. They imply that channel geometry is related to a dominant discharge. For this to be so, the river must be ‘in regime' i.e. its characteristics must fluctuate about a mean condition which is effectively stationary at the time scale considered. The static regression-dominant discharge approach does not fully describe the relationship between channel characteristics and discharge and an alternative model is proposed with the form y(t) = ∞ 00h(u)- q(t-u)du. This model states that channel form is a product of the whole series of discharges experienced by the channel. The dominant discharge-static regression approach provides a working approximation of the relationship between channel characteristics and discharge only when temporal variations in q are small or when y is insensitive to variations in q.},

abstract = {Previous studies of surface particle structures in gravel-bed rivers, in particular coarse-grain clusters, conclude that these bedforms increase bed stability and reduce sediment transport rates. However, few studies have quantitatively analysed the effect of the surface distribution of coarse grains, in isolation or arranged into distinct bedforms, on particle entrainment, focussing on descriptions of bedform formation and mechanical behaviour. A novel image analysis technique was employed that allowed recognition of coarse grains and calculation of particle cluster areas. Under laboratory conditions, increasing discharges were applied to a unimodal sand-gravel bed. The size class containing the D90 size was painted in ultraviolet paint. Image analysis software was used to identify this size class on digital images of the bed surface taken under ultraviolet light. Both the total surface area occupied by ultraviolet grains and the area of accumulations of connected grains were related to the threshold shear stress for entrainment. As discharge magnitude increased, coarse grains actively grouped together forming fewer, larger accumulations of coarse particles. Lower values of critical bed shear stress occurred for beds with higher degrees of clustering; beds are more stable when coarse grains are distributed more evenly over the bed surface; this implies that using bed surface composition as a descriptor of bed resistance to entrainment may need to be complemented by a descriptor of the spatial distribution of the coarsest grains.},

abstract = {The path length (downstream displacement over a given time period) of individual bed particles in gravel-bed rivers is central to morphological methods for measuring bed load transport rate and is also fundamental to understanding the bed load transport process and the development of channel morphology. Previous studies of particle movement using tracers report predominantly strongly positively skewed frequency distributions of path length with modes close to the point of entrainment. However, gravel-bed rivers often have regularly spaced erosion (scour pools) and deposition (channel bars) sites that are several channel widths apart and it is reasonable to expect that particle path length would reflect this morphological scale, at least during flows large enough to create and modify the morphology. Here, we synthesize and re-analyze results from published bed load tracing experiments in gravel-bed rivers to identify the variety of possible path length distributions for differing channel morphology, channel dimensions, bed particle size, and particle mobility (i.e. flow magnitude) and to look for occurrences of path length coinciding with the length scale of the morphology. The results show that path length distributions may be positively skewed, symmetrical, and uni-, bi-, or multi-modal and may include modes that coincide with known or expected pool–bar spacing. Primary path length modes equivalent to possible pool–bar spacing are more probable at higher non-dimensional bed shear stress, from which it is inferred that both particle mobility and channel morphology exert an influence on particle path lengths and that particle movement is unlikely to be stochastic except at relatively low particle mobility. Existing data are inadequate for more than a preliminary analysis of this problem consequently there is a need for new data collected explicitly and systematically to confirm these preliminary results, isolate the effect of the several variables that influence the characteristics of path length frequency distributions and identify the conditions under which path length coincides with the length scale of the dominant morphology.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT We study the steady three-dimensional flow field and bed topography in a channel with sinusoidally varying width, under the assumptions of small-amplitude width variations and sufficiently wide channel to neglect nonlinear effects and sidewall effects. The aim of the work is to investigate the role of width variations in producing channel bifurcation in braided rivers. We infer incipient bifurcation in cases where the growth of a central bar leads to planimetric instability of the channel, i.e. when the given infinitesimal width perturbation is enhanced. Results of the three-dimensional model suggest that the equilibrium bottom profile mainly consists of a purely longitudinal component, uniformly distributed over the cross-section, which induces deposition at the wide section and scour at the constriction, and of a transverse component in the form of a central bar (wide sections) and scour (constrictions), with longitudinal wavelength equal to that of width variations. A comparison between the results of the three-dimensional model and those obtained by means of a two-dimensional depth-averaged approach shows that the transverse component is mainly related to three-dimensional effects. Theoretical findings display a satisfactory agreement with results of flume experiments. Transverse variations are responsible for the planimetric instability of the channel; we find that in the range of values of Shields stress typical of braided rivers, the incipient bifurcation is enhanced as the width ratio of the channel increases.},

abstract = {Meanders, or frequent sinuous reversals of channel curvature, are a fundamental characteristic of river planform. Although the cause of meandering has attracted attention since the beginning of civilization, as yet there is no completely satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon. The self-similarity of meander geometry over a wide range of scales and environmental conditions suggests that meandering reflects the influence of some general control (Davy and Davies, 1979). Various arguments have been advanced to explain why rivers meander, including dissipation of excess energy (Jefferson, 1902; Inglis, 1947), minimization of energy expenditure (Yang, 1971; Chang, 1988), and minimization of the variance in bed shear stress and boundary friction (Langbein and Leopold, 1966). These theories provide predictions that conform well with observed forms, but they are primarily teleological in nature and thus difficult to evaluate scientifically; minimization of energy or shear stress could just as easily be the result of meandering as it could the cause (Richards, 1982: 28). More important, these arguments do not describe how meanders develop. Over the past 25 years, considerable effort has been devoted to identifying the physical processes that initiate the development of meanders in straight channels. This research has focused on inter-relationships among fluid dynamics, sediment transport, bed morphology, and bank erosion; the goal is to develop a hydrodynamic explanation of meandering. Although much of this work has occurred outside geography, it has relevance to physical geographers, particularly fluvial geomorphologists, for at least two reasons. First, it relates directly to geomorphic theory concerning the basic nature of meandering rivers and their sedimentary deposits. Secondly, geomorphologists are in a position to contribute substantively to theory development because many postulates of hydrodynamic theories have not been rigorously tested in the field. The purposes of this paper are: 1) to review current hydrodynamic concepts related to meander initiation; and 2) to provide direction for future geomorphologic investigations so that they may contribute directly to theory enhancement. The approach taken here is to summarize the salient ideas embodied in various theories. For detailed reviews of mathematical formulations the reader is referred to Diplas et al. (1988) and Seminara and Tubino (1989).},

abstract = {The riffle-pool sequence has not been subjected to the same level of intensive research as the meandering planform, although riffles and pools may be a fundamental prerequisite for meandering. The pseudo-cyclic oscillation of the bed in a riffle-pool stream suggests the application of a variety of techniques of spatial series analysis, which provide objective measures of riffle wavelength, and suggest processes capable of explaining riffles and pools and their relationship with meanders. The second-order autoregressive process is suggested as a stochastic process which models the bed-profile oscillation. Velocity pulsations associated with large scale turbulent eddies are probably responsible for accretions and erosions which interact with the flow to maintain these perturbations, so that sections lagged by distances of 2$\pi$w are positively correlated. The effect of the riffle-pool sequence on flow geometry is far more significant than the effects of plan geometry or of downstream variations, which supports the view that this feature is a fundamental aspect of channel morphometry. There is a tendency, however, for curved reaches to exhibit reduced variance of roughness, velocity, and water surface slope, which reinforces the minimization hypothesis. The extreme temporal variation between riffle and pool flow characteristics demands that any classificatory scheme uses scale-free and stable measures, and a discriminant analysis using hydraulic exponents represents a convenient summary of the field data.},

abstract = {Numerous velocity profiles were measured along a riffle-pool sequence for three different flow conditions. For each flow condition (ranging from baseflow to about of bankfull depth), ten to fifteen velocity profiles were measured along the same transect. The objectives of the study were: (i) to differentiate between components of bed roughness and shear stress attributed to surface friction and large-scale bed undulations, and (ii) to investigate the effects of fluctuating discharges on the mean vertical flow structure in pools and riffles. No previous attempts have been made to investigate scales of bed roughness from velocity profiles along riffle-pool sequences and to determine how near-bed velocity gradients change with increasing flow discharge. At low flows (and as expected), riffles are characterized by higher near-bed velocity gradients than pools. Similarly, average bed shear stresses, as determined from measurements of flow depth and energy gradient, indicate a greater resistance and bed shear stress in riffle sections. Invariably, however, local shear stresses as determined from near-bed velocity gradients in pools and in riffles are much smaller than reach averages estimated from measurements of depth and slope. The shape of spatially averaged velocity profiles changes as discharges increases. The difference in terms of near-bed velocities between pools and riffles decreases as discharge increases which suggests that a velocity reversal may occur at or near bankfull. Further away from the bed surface, velocity differences between pools and riffles do remain significant. Finally, the curvature of the velocity profiles is more significant at high flows and surface roughness is maximized when flow conditions are intermediate, perhaps a result of increasing density of small-scale sedimentary structures.},

abstract = {The experience of river scientists leads them to propose ecosystem variability as a central theme in management. The real challenge however lies in developing collective understanding, and integration, within and between scientists, citizens and management agencies. The prevailing view of scientists as experts who solve environmental problems is fallacious. A broad societal response, supported by humble public service agencies and scientists in the service of society, is more likely to succeed. This paper proposes a framework for structuring the science/management/society partnerships, and is based on experiences from managing rivers flowing through the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Scientists need to place between-discipline communication, constructive synthesis of their collective understanding and diffusion of this understanding into civil society, much higher on their collective agenda. Entering problem solving situations as co-learners, rather than experts, facilitates partnership building. Managers need to focus on: (1) preparing society to engage the knowledge, the problem and the solutions needed to achieve some collectively defined set of future conditions; (2) actively engage scientists in the development of technology for altering patterns of resource use and (3) undertake actions needed to achieve the desired future distribution of the costs and benefits of resource use in society. Managers have a very limited tool box with which to work, and modern society has largely transferred the risk of failure to them. Society therefore needs to accept more responsibility in these partnerships of co-operative decision-making. It should engage in them with a ‘public good' ethic, a vision for a shared future, and an acceptance that resource and technological limits ultimately determine the distribution of costs and benefits of ecosystem services. Successful partnerships are based on adaptive management processes driven by consensus decision-making to ensure better distribution of knowledge, risks, humility and rewards in common property resource management. To achieve this we need to learn new ways to manage, while managing new ways to learn. Three models, social learning, learning communities and learning organizations, provide focus for learning.

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

abstract = {Compared to lower-gradient channels, steep mountain streams typically have rougher beds and shallower flow depths, making macro-scale flow resistance (due to, e.g., immobile boulders and irregular bedforms) more important as controls on sediment transport. The marked differences in hydraulics, flow resistance, and grain mobility between steep and lower-gradient streams raise the question of whether the same equations can predict bed load transport rates across wide ranges of channel gradients. We studied a steep, glacier-fed mountain stream (Riedbach, Ct. Valais, Switzerland) that provides a natural experiment for exploring how stream gradients affect bed load transport rates. The streambed gradient increases over a 1 km stream reach by roughly one order of magnitude (from 3{\%} to 38{\%}), while flow discharge and width remain approximately constant. Sediment transport rates were determined in the 3{\%} reach using Bunte bed load traps and in the 38{\%} reach using the Swiss plate geophone system. Despite a ten-fold increase in bed gradient, bed load transport rates did not increase substantially. Observed transport rates for these two very different bed gradients could be predicted reasonably well by using a flow resistance partitioning approach to account for increasing bed roughness (D84 changes from 0.17 m to 0.91 m) within a fractional bed load transport equation. This suggests that sediment transport behavior across this large range of steep slopes agrees with patterns established in previous studies for both lower-gradient and steep reaches, and confirms the applicability of the flow resistance and bed load transport equations at very steep slopes.},

abstract = {A series of experiments was performed in a large flume to determine the effect of slope and sediment load on channel patterns. Sediment loads and slopes were closely related, and as slope and sediment loads increased, threshold values of these variables were encountered, at which channel patterns altered significantly. At a very low slope and sediment load, the channels remained straight, but at a discharge of 0.15 cfs, a meandering-thalweg channel formed at slopes greater than 0.002. With increased slope and sediment loads, thalweg sinuosity increased to a maximum of 1.25. At slopes greater than 0.016, a braided channel formed. The model channels responded to increased sediment loads by maintaining steeper gradients and by major channel pattern changes, but at very gentle slopes and at steep slopes, the channel could not be forced to develop a meandering thalweg. These experiments suggest that landforms may not always respond progressively to altered conditions. Rather, dramatic morphologic changes can occur abruptly when critical erosional and (or) depositional threshold values are exceeded. The meandering-thalweg channel was not a meandering channel. A truly meandering channel with a sinuosity of 1.3 formed when a suspended-sediment load (3 percent concentrations of kaolinite) was introduced into the flow. The clay stabilized the alternate bars, and scour and deepening of the thalweg resulted. This in turn lowered the water level at constant discharge, and the alternate bars emerged o t form point bars. A meandering-thalweg channel was thus converted to a meandering channel by the type of sediment load change that has accompanied climatic and hydrologic changes of the recent geologic past.},

abstract = {Streams in urban and urbanizing watersheds are impacted by altered runoff hydrology and sediment yields, floodplain modifications, and channel relocations. One morphological response to urbanization is degradation of riffle-pool sequences. Pools and riffles are fundamental mesohabitat units where many lotic biota have evolved to occupy preferentially, and support diverse biological communities. Restoring self-maintaining pool-riffle structures is essential to the ecological rehabilitation of urban streams when lost. However restoring these structures can be problematic in straightened urban streams constrained by civil infrastructure preventing channel re-meandering. The project goal was to utilize geomorphic, hydraulic, and ecological principles to rehabilitate a study reach in a confined geomorphic setting with a primary emphasis on developing a stable riffle design that improves habitat patch dynamics.

abstract = {Abstract Streams in urban and urbanizing watersheds are impacted by altered runoff hydrology and sediment yields, floodplain modifications, and channel relocations. One morphological response to urbanization is degradation of riffle-pool sequences. Pools and riffles are fundamental mesohabitat units where many lotic biota have evolved to occupy preferentially, and support diverse biological communities. Restoring self-maintaining pool-riffle structures is essential to the ecological rehabilitation of urban streams when lost. However restoring these structures can be problematic in straightened urban streams constrained by civil infrastructure preventing channel re-meandering. The project goal was to utilize geomorphic, hydraulic, and ecological principles to rehabilitate a study reach in a confined geomorphic setting with a primary emphasis on developing a stable riffle design that improves habitat patch dynamics. A 270-m tree-lined study site was selected on Beaver Creek, Knox County, East Tennessee. Through experimental 3D and 2D hydraulic modeling, a riffle-pool design was developed consisting of removing trees at expanded channel locations, placing 3.8-cm gravel substrate for the riffle bed, and deepening the pool prior to riffle entrance. Riffle-pool maintenance processes of the proposed design included occurrence of shear stress reversal between low- and high-flows, and high-flow acceleration-deceleration from pools to riffles.

abstract = {Bed‐load particles tend to move downslope in response to gravity and downstream in response to fluid drag. The effect of gravity becomes particularly important when the downslope gravitational force has a component normal to the streamwise direction. Such phenomena as bank erosion, bed topography in river bends, sediment sorting, and stream braiding are strongly influenced by transverse bed‐load transport under the influence of gravity. Here, the problem is analyzed from a consideration of the dynamics of saltating grains. Simultaneous solution of the streamwise and transverse equations of motion for a grain saltating on a transversely tilting bed of moderate slope allows a determination of mean particle trajectory. This mean trajectory, while predominately directed in the streamwise direction, includes a transverse downslope component as well. The results are used to determine a relation for the ratio of transverse to streamwise bed‐load transport. This ratio increases with increasing transverse slope an...},

Using a step-by-step method, the book identifies the important geological variables of physical-chemical geoscience problems and describes the mechanisms that control these variables. This book is directed toward upper-level undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers, and professionals who want to learn how to abstract complex systems into sets of dynamic equations. It shows students how to recognize domains of interest and key factors, and how to explain assumptions in formal terms. The book reveals what data best tests ideas of how nature works, and cautions against inadequate transport laws, unconstrained coefficients, and unfalsifiable models. Various examples of processes and systems, and ample illustrations, are provided. Students using this text should be familiar with the principles of physics, chemistry, and geology, and have taken a year of differential and integral calculus.

Only in some cases are the computed stream profiles fit exactly by any one of the commonly supported mathematical function analogs to graded profile form-exponential, logarithmic, or power function, but in most cases any of these functions can provide a fit with a degree of error smaller than would be noted in treating field data. Profiles dominated by spatial change in fluid and sediment discharge are distinctly power functions, while profiles dominated by sediment size reduction are not necessarily exponential in form. Other important controls on profile shape are the degree of downstream width change in response to increasing discharge and the general range of sediment size. A dynamic model of a river's approach to grade indicates that disequilibrium river profiles closely approximate a graded profile shape even while the general slope is relatively high, and significant erosion remains to achieve equilibrium.},

abstract = {Sediment of different size are transported in rivers under the action of flow. The first and still most popular sediment continuity model able to deal with mixed sediment is the so-called active layer model proposed by Hirano (1971, 1972). In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional hydromorphodynamic model given by the Saint-Venant equations for free-surface flow coupled with the active layer model. We perform a mathematical analysis of this model, extending the previous analysis by Ribberink (1987), including full unsteadiness and grainsize selectivity of the transported load by explicitly considering multiple sediment fractions. The presence of multiple fractions gives rise to distinct waves traveling in the downstream direction, for which we provide an analytical approximation of propagation velocity under any Froude regime. We finally investigate the role of different waves in advecting morphodynamic changes through the domain. To this aim, we implement an analytical linearized solver to analyze the propagation of small-amplitude perturbations of the bed elevation and grainsize distribution of the active layer as described by the system of governing equations. We find that initial gradients in the grainsize distribution of the active layer are able to trigger significant bed variations, which propagate in the downstream direction at faster pace than the “bed” wave arising from the unisize-sediment Saint-Venant-Exner model. We also verify that multiple “sorting” waves carry multiple associated bed perturbations, traveling at different speeds.},

abstract = {The study analyses the morphological response of a gravel-bed river to discharges of different magnitude (from moderate events that occur several times a year to a 12-year flood) and so defines the range of formative discharges for single morphological units (channels, bars, islands) and a range of magnitude of morphological activity from the threshold discharges for gravel transport and minor bar modification up to flows causing major morphological changes.The study was conducted on the Tagliamento River, a large gravel-bed river in north-eastern Italy, using two different methods, analysis of aerial photographs and field observation of painted gravel particles. The available photographs (five flights from August 1997 to November 2002) and the two commissioned flights (June 2006 and April 2007) do not define periods with a single flood event, but the intervals are short enough (11 to 22 months) to have a limited number of flood events in each case. The fieldwork, which involved cross-section survey, grain-size analysis and observation of painted sediments, complemented the aerial surveys by allowing analysis of channel response to single flood events.Substantial morphological changes (e.g. bank erosion of several tens of metres up to more than 100 m) associated with flood events with a recurrence interval between 1{\textperiodcentered}1 year and 12 years have been documented. Multiple forming discharges were defined based on the activity of different morphological units. Discharges equal to 20–50{\%} of the bankfull discharge are formative for the channels, whereas the bankfull discharge (1{\textperiodcentered}1 year flood in this case of the Tagliamento River) is formative for low bars. Larger floods, but still relatively frequent (with a recurrence interval less than five years), are required for full gravel transport on high bars and significant morphological changes of islands.

abstract = {The major bedforms of gravel bed rivers, whether braided, meandering or straight, may be usefully resolved into pool-riffle units, each comprising a single scour pool together with an associated depositional shoal downstream. At low flow, the latter may be characterized by a single emergent bar-head and submerged riffle, or by a variety of remnant braid bars, depending upon the type of channel. Identification of pool-riffle units and observation of associated flow structures on a small meandering stream in northwest England has demonstrated important links between bedforms, flow patterns and channel change. Each unit appears to be associated with a systematic pattern of secondary flows, which are able to modify the bedforms and initiate meander development. Feedback links between plan morphology, flow patterns and erosive and depositional forces within these units ensure that each stage of meander growth has a characteristic style of channel change. Consequently, meanders tend to evolve by regular cycles of increasing curvature and complexity.},

abstract = {Pools and riffles are important bedforms that are one of the most recognized features in rivers having less than 0.02 gradient. Pools are classified as deep areas with low velocities at low stage, whereas riffles exhibit higher water-surface slopes and faster velocities. Pools and riffles exist in both alluvial and bedrock channels, but are best developed in gravel-bed substrates and meandering channels. These undulations in bed topography provide the primary framework for aquatic habitat in channels, and are of great interest because of their importance for macro-invertebrates and fish species. An increasing number of articles propose that convergence of flow and enhanced turbulent conditions are necessary conditions for pool–riffle formation. Complex hydraulic patterns lead to a skewed distribution of feature-to-feature distances that tend to average five-to-seven bankfull widths apart. Pool depth, length, and volume tend to increase with larger drainage area and decrease with more sediment supply. Few details of controls on riffle geometry are presently known. The sequences eventually create stage-dependent form resistance with higher forces in pools at high flow and sediment-sorting patterns that maintain the morphology and enhance habitat complexity.},

abstract = {Flume experiments were conducted in a 6-m flume to determine the role of turbulence in the scour of pools. Paired results from constricted-flow experiments with and without a wake zone formed behind obstructions to flow show that pools are deeper and shorter when vertical free-shear layers are present. Although non-streamlined obstructions initially present more resistance to flow, channel-bed scour develops a pool morphology that lowers mechanical energy losses to levels below those in pools with streamlined obstructions. Scour primarily enlarges the cross-sectional area in the constricted section. Feedback between pool geometry and localized turbulence production play a secondary role in total scour but still exert a major influence on final energy slopes. The experiment shows that pools with wake zones evolve to reduce longitudinal energy expenditure with an associated reduction in total turbulence production associated with the obstruction.},

abstract = {A field-based project was initiated to characterize the influence of varying discharge and bed topography along a pool exit-slope on the strength of turbulence generated by vortex shedding. Velocities were measured with an ADV downstream of a boulder constriction within a shear zone of a large pool. Measurements were repeated for four flows that varied from 20{\%} to 50{\%} of bankfull discharge. An additional longitudinal profile was conducted along the pool thalweg. Plots of velocity demonstrate high near-bed velocities and turbulence levels in the pools. Turbulence levels were highest closer to the constriction in the shear zone. Turbulent kinetic energy decayed in the downstream direction in response to the bed topography and at lower discharges. Instantaneous velocities are large enough to temporarily lift pebbles at this depth. It appears that instantaneous forces created by vortex shedding may play an important role in scouring pools downstream of constrictions. The turbulence may also respond to changes in bed topography in a manner that encourages feedbacks among bed topography, characteristics of turbulence, and sediment transport.},

abstract = {Pools and riffles are natural bedforms that produce variations in width and depth along channels deemed critical for aquatic habitat. An understanding of this morphology is necessary for the successful design of a reconstructed or restored channel. To better understand pool geometry and sorting characteristics of New England channels, characterizations of pool geometry were performed on 145 different pools strongly influenced by channel constrictions. Characterizations of channel-bed sediments were also performed at 34 of these locations. Data from 120 pools were used in least-squares, multiple-regression analysis with 19 different independent variables to develop prediction equations for pool depth, length, and exit-slope gradient. These equations were then tested using the 25 remaining pools. Eighteen different geometric variables were then used to predict sediment $\phi$50 values in pool centers, pool exit slopes, and riffles for the subset of 34 samples. The regression analyses for pool geometry indicate that pool depth is significantly influenced to a decreasing degree by pool exit-slope width, constriction gradient, constriction width, drainage area, upstream channel width, and the exit-slope expansion ratio, with an R2 value of 0.53. Similarly, pool length is influenced by channel gradient, location of the channel constriction, pool width, drainage area and constriction length, with an R2 value of 0.72. The gradient of pool exit slope is influenced by drainage area, channel gradient, and constriction gradient, with an R2 value of 0.34. However, R2 values for exit slope increased to 0.65 when sediment d50 data were utilized. Using the resulting regression equations to predict dimensions for the 25 verification pools yields average residuals near zero, although moderate variations do exist. A Tukey–Kramer HSD comparison of the means for sediment $\phi$50 values indicates pool sediments are significantly coarser than pool exit-slope and riffle sediments for the subset of 34 pools. Regression analyses also suggest significant relations between the size of sediments in pools and riffles and a combination of geometric variables with R2 values that range from 0.45 to 0.62. The results suggest that pool dimensions are related to basin-wide variability and local hydraulic conditions. The findings also suggest that the characteristics of constrictions and the downstream section of pools provide an important control on scouring and sorting characteristics throughout the pool–riffle morphology.},

abstract = {A series of 18 flume runs were conducted in a 6-m long, 0.5-m wide recirculating flume with a bed gradient of 0.8{\%} to determine the influence of obstruction shape on the formation and characteristics of forced pools. Six different- shaped obstructions were added to the flume with the maxi- mum width of the obstruction held constant at 20 cm, which equaled a 40{\%} constriction of flow. The obstruction shapes used included a square, a rectangle, a right triangle with the hypotenuse-facing upstream, a right triangle with the hypotenuse-facing downstream, a combination of a square and triangle with the hypotenuse-facing upstream, and a rect- angle and semi-circle shape. Three flume runs were con- ducted with each obstruction shape. A profile of the flume bed was taken after each experiment and a grid measurement of bed elevations for the last run were conducted to create to- pographic maps of the flume bed to compare pool-riffle mor- phologies. ANOVA results indicate pool depth, pool loca- tion, and the distance between the pool center and the riffle crest all vary with the obstruction shape. Obstructions with a more blunt upstream face created deeper pools, more to- tal scour and longer pool-riffle sequence lengths than pools formed by obstructions with a more gradual narrowing of flow. The increased volume of scour associated with obstruc- tions that rapidly narrow flow also creates larger volume rif- fles that cover a greater extent of the channel bed.},

abstract = {An experimental and computational research approach was used to determine interactions between pool geometry and hydraulics. A 20-m-long, 1.8-m-wide flume was used to investigate the effect of four different geometric aspects of pool shape on flow velocity. Plywood sections were used to systematically alter constriction width, pool depth, pool length, and pool exit-slope gradient, each at two separate levels. Using the resulting 16 unique geometries with measured pool velocities in four-way factorial analyses produced an empirical assessment of the role of the four geometric aspects on the pool flow patterns and hence the stability of the pool. To complement the conclusions of these analyses, a two-dimensional computational flow model was used to investigate the relationships between pool geometry and flow patterns over a wider range of conditions. Both experimental and computational results show that constriction and depth effects dominate in the jet section of the pool and that pool length exhibits an increasing effect within the recirculating-eddy system. The pool exit slope appears to force flow reattachment. Pool length controls recirculating-eddy length and vena contracta strength. In turn, the vena contracta and recirculating eddy control velocities throughout the pool.},

abstract = {Sediment-sorting processes related to varying channel-bed morphology were investigated from April to November 1993 along a 1-km pool-riffle and step-pool reach of North Saint Vrain Creek, a small mountain stream in the Rocky Mountains of northern Colorado. Measured cross-sectional areas of flow were used to suggest higher velocities in pools than in riffles at high flow. Three hundred and sixteen tracer particles, ranging in size from 16 mm to 256 mm, were placed in two separate pool-riffle-pool sequences and used to assess sediment-sorting patterns and sediment-transport competence variations. Tracer-particle depositional evidence indicated higher sediment-transport competence in pools than in riffles at high flow. Pool-riffle sediment sorting may be created by velocity reversals, and more localized sorting results from gravitational forces along the upstream sloping portion of the channel bed located at the downstream end of pools.

Geological Society of America Bulletin 82, 753–756] hypothesized that at high flow, near-bed velocities in pools exceed velocities in riffles and create pool scour. Pools, however, typically have larger cross-sectional areas of flow at bankfull discharge. This condition raises an inconsistency with Keller's velocity reversal hypothesis and the one-dimensional continuity of mass equation. To address this problem, a model of pool maintenance and sediment sorting is proposed that relies on constriction of flow by recirculating eddies and flow divergence over the exit-slopes of pools. According to the model, a narrow zone of high velocity occurs in the center of pools, creating scour. Along the downstream end of pools, an uphill climb of particles up the pool exit-slope promotes sediment deposition. The model is tested with field and flume measurements of velocity, water-surface elevation, and size of bed sediments in recirculating-eddy influenced pools. Local reversals of the water-surface gradient were measured in the field and a velocity reversal was created in the flume. The reversals that were measured indicate higher gradients of the water surface over the upstream portions of pools and higher velocities in pools at high flow. The distribution of bed sediments collected in the field also support the proposed model of pool maintenance.},

abstract = {Riverine ecosystems are complex features of the landscape displaying structures and processes that reflect the influence of many variables at a range of scales. Thus, the physical, chemical and ecological character of riverine ecosystems differs between them and may change over time, often at different rates and in different ways. In addition, the structure and function of riverine ecosystems also varies downstream. Rivers are process-response systems whereby changes to discharge and sediment load induce a range of ecosystem responses. Those river systems subject to highly variable process regimes may be expected to exhibit enhanced levels of complexity and display processform relationships commensurate of this variability, where both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions can exist. The process-form relationships and interactions between the physical, chemical and ecological templates of highly variable riverine ecosystems challenge some of the accepted wisdoms of river system functioning. This paper introduces some of these challenges and the general theme of the ten papers of this special issue of River Research and Applications.

abstract = {Equilibrium is a single word that embraces multiple concepts. The largely qualitative use of equilibrium within geomorphology has fostered imprecision and even outright error; as a result the term, for many, has degenerated to the status of a non-corrigible regulative principle. Although a few geomorphologists make precise use of equilibria terminology, their precision is invariably lost on the larger audience. Equilibrium is associated with force in dynamics, with energy in thermodynamics (and probability by extension), and with pure numerical behavior in mathematics. In General System Theory, equilibrium is derived from thermodynamics but applied, by analogy, almost exclusively to mass. In addition, a purely geomorphic version of equilibrium (dynamic equilibrium) stems from the work of G. K. Gilbert (1876; 1877) and is based on sediment flux at the basin scale. Unfortunately, Gilbert's concept/term has been distorted by some geomorphologists in their attempt to establish linkage between equilibria concepts, especially between those relating to energy and mass. This paper reviews and reconsiders the various equilibria concepts. An updated version of Gilbert's dynamic equilibrium based on sediment transfer proposed by Ahnert (n.d.), and termed by us "mass flux equilibrium," holds promise. In addition, the purely mathematical concept of equilibrium outlined by Howard (1988) has considerable utility, provided union with geomorphological theory is achieved. Given the difficulty of measuring thermal energy in the field, its inefficient use in nature, and the uncertainty with which it and form can be related, thermodynamic equilibria concepts would appear, presently, to offer geomorphologists only very limited opportunities.},

abstract = {Rivers are largely responsible for shaping the Earth's continental landscapes. River patterns, the spatial arrangements of channels in the landscape, are determined by slope and structure. At site and sector scale, channel morphology varies spatially and in time, but river patterns and drainage texture, or the frequency of stream lines per unit area, together determine the intricacy, or otherwise, of topography. Most river patterns evolve through natural selection. Slope induces the formation of such patterns as parallel, radial and distributary, while structure produces straight, angular, trellis and annular arrangements. Once established, patterns tend to persist. Nevertheless, at many sites the usual patterns have been disturbed and patterns that are anomalous in terms of slope and structure have been produced by diversion, tectonism, volcanism, glaciation, mass movements, and human activities; by antecedence, superimposition, inheritance or underprinting; by the persistence of deeply eroding rivers which encounter alien structures; and by climatic change. River patterns provide clues to underlying structure and to the chronology of events. They have also proved significant in the search for minerals.},

abstract = {The longitudinal profiles of bedrock channels are a major component of the relief structure of mountainous drainage basins and therefore limit the elevation of peaks and ridges. Further, bedrock channels communicate tectonic and climatic signals across the landscape, thus dictating, to first order, the dynamic response of mountainous landscapes to external forcings. We review and explore the stream-power erosion model in an effort to (1) elucidate its consequences in terms of large-scale topographic (fluvial) relief and its sensitivity to tectonic and climatic forcing, (2) derive a relationship for system response time to tectonic perturbations, (3) determine the sensitivity of model behavior to various model parameters, and (4) integrate the above to suggest useful guidelines for further study of bedrock channel systems and for future refinement of the streampower erosion law. Dimensional analysis reveals that the dynamic behavior of the stream-power erosion model is governed by a single nondimensional group that we term the uplift-erosion number, greatly reducing the number of variables that need to be considered in the sensitivity analysis. The degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between stream incision rate and channel gradient (slope exponent n) emerges as a fundamental unknown. The physics of the active erosion processes directly influence this nonlinearity, which is shown to dictate the relationship between the uplift-erosion number, the equilibrium stream channel gradient, and the total fluvial relief of mountain ranges. Similarly, the predicted response time to changes in rock uplift rate is shown to depend on climate, rock strength, and the magnitude of tectonic perturbation, with the slope exponent n controlling the degree of dependence on these various factors. For typical drainage basin geometries the response time is relatively insensitive to the size of the system. Work on the physics of bedrock erosion processes, their sensitivity to extreme floods, their transient responses to sudden changes in climate or uplift rate, and the scaling of local rock erosion studies to reach-scale modeling studies are most sorely needed.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract In the last decades, insights from the fields of ecology, geomorphology, and hydrology have been applied to the question of the streamflows necessary for environmental maintenance. For instance, determining the streamflow needed for spawning by salmon or trout requires ascertaining how much water, for how long, and at what time it will be needed? And what flows are necessary for the sustenance of streamside vegetation? Answers to these and similar questions have been sought to minimize environmental degradation in the development or relicensing of water projects, in restoring riverine ecosystems, and in balancing multiple uses for limited water resources. In this contribution, the varieties of environmental maintenance flows applied to rivers are described, as are their fundamental principles. These environmental maintenance flows include flows to maintain aesthetics and recreation, streambed sediment size and its mobility, the channel, its features and continuity, and the floodplain, its wetne...},

abstract = {Field observations in streams with beds of coarse sand and fine gravel have revealed that bedload moves primarily as thin, migrating accumulations of sediment, and coarse grains cluster at their leading edge. These accumulations are one or two coarse grains high and are much longer (0.2-0.6 m long in sand; 0.5-2.0 m in fine gravel) than their height. We propose the term "bedload sheet" for these features, and we argue that they result from an instability inherent to bedload movement of moderately and poorly sorted sediment. In essence, coarse particles in the bedload slow or stop each other, trap finer particles in their interstices, and thus cause the coarse particles to become mobile again. Bedload sheets develop on the stoss side of dunes, causing the dune to advance incrementally with the arrival of each sheet. Successive deposition of coarse sediment from the leading edge followed by fine sediment may generate the grain-size sorting that distinguishes cross-bedding. Available flume experiments and field observations indicate that bedload sheets are a common, but generally unrecognized, feature of heterogeneous sediment transport.},

Fractional transport rates are referenced to the size distribution of the bed surface, rather than subsurface, making the model completely explicit and capable of predicting transient conditions. The model is developed using a new data set of 48 coupled observations of flow, transport, and bed surface grain size using five different sediments. The model incorporates a hiding function that resolves discrepancies observed among earlier hiding functions. The model uses the full size distribution of the bed surface, including sand, and incorporates a nonlinear effect of sand content on gravel transport rate not included in previous models. The model shares some common elements with two previous surface-based transport models, but differs in using the full surface size distribution and in that it is directly developed from a relatively comprehensive data set with unambiguous measurement of surface grain size over a range of flow, transport rate, and...},

The active floodplain is the most meaningful bank-full level to the fluvial geomorphologist, whereas the banks of the valley flat are the most important to engineers. Comparison of 16 ways of determining bank-full discharge suggests that bank-full discharge at gaged sites should be obtained from the station's rating curve, where bank-full gage height is determined from a longitudinal profile of the floodplain along the entire reach. At ungaged sites, bank-full discharge can be estimated from the empirical equation of this study or from the Gauckler-Manning equation. In the latter case the resistance coefficient n should be estimated at the field site for bank-full flow; a measured low-flow n should not be used. Bank-full discharge does not have a common recurrence frequency among the rivers studied, and the discharge corresponding to the 1.5-year recurrence interval in most cases does not represent the bank-full discharge.},

abstract = {The depths of pools relative to the dephts of runs and riffles were correlated with reach-scale channel gradient along three rivers in coastal northern California. The sample included 122 pools formed in channels with gradients from 0.172 to 0.002. Relative pool depth on these rivers, and relative distance between pools, increase as channel gradient decreases. Mean pool:riffle depth is 2.8:1 at the highest channel gradient, and 6.2:1 at the lowest gradient, while mean pool:riffle length is 1:0.8 at high channel gradient, and 1:1.8 at low channel gradient. We hypothesize that these trends reflect changes in energy expenditure with decreasing gradient, as a result of the flow's ability to erode its channel boundaries. Channel reaches with high gradients are characterized by resistant channel boundaries, coarse material, and relatively low discharge and total stream power. Channel reaches with low gradients have less resistant channel boundaries, finger-grained bed material, and higher values of discharge and total stream power. These changes in channel and flow characteristics with decreasing gradient result in flows in high-gradient reaches expending a greater proportion of their energy in overcoming boundary and internal resistance, with less energy available for channel-bed scour and the formation of pools in their relatively resistant channels. In contrast, with less energy available for channel-bed scour the channel bed, creating deeper pools because the channel boundaries are less resistant, and the proportion of flow energy available for sediment entrainment and transport should be greater.},

abstract = {The basic patterns and processes of steep channels remain poorly known relative to lower-gradient channels. In this analysis, characteristics of step-pool, plane-bed, and pool-riffle channels are examined using a data set of 335 channel reaches from the western United States, Nepal, New Zealand, and Panama. We analyzed differences among the three channel types with respect to hydraulics, channel geometry, boundary roughness, and bedforms. Step-pool channels have significantly steeper gradients, coarser substrate, higher values of shear stress and stream power for a given discharge, and larger ratios of bedform amplitude/wavelength (H/L). Pool-riffle channels have greater width/depth ratios and relative grain submergence (R/D84) than the other channel types. Plane-bed channels tend to have intermediate values for most variables examined. Relative form submergence (R/H) is statistically similar for step-pool and pool-riffle channels. Despite the lesser relative grain submergence and greater bedform amplitude of step-pool channels, mean values of Darcy–Weisbach friction factor do not change in response to changes in relative grain submergence. These patterns suggest that adjustments along mountain streams effectively maximize resistance to flow and minimize downstream variability in resistance among the different channel types.},

abstract = {The relative importance in geomorphic processes of extreme or catastrophic events and more frequent events of smaller magnitude can be measured in terms of (1) the relative amounts of "work" done on the landscape and (2) in terms of the formation of specific features of the landscape. For many processes, above the level of competence, the rate of movement of material can be expressed as a power function of some stress, as for example, shear stress. Because the frequency distributions of the magnitudes of many natural events, such as floods, rainfall, and wind speeds, approximate log-normal distributions, the product of frequency and rate, a measure of the work performed by events having different frequencies and magnitudes will attain a maximum. The frequency at which this maximum occurs provides a measure of the level at which the largest portion of the total work is accomplished. Analysis of records of sediment transported by rivers indicates that the largest portion of the total load is carried by flows which occur on the average once or twice each year. As the variability of the flow increases and hence as the size of the drainage basin decreases, a larger percentage of the total load is carried by less frequent flows. In many basins 90 per cent of the sediment is removed by storm discharges which recur at least once every five years. Transport of sand and dust by wind in general follows the same laws. The extreme velocities associated with infrequent events are compensated for by their rarity, and it is found that the greatest bulk of sediment is transported by more moderate events. Many rivers are competent to erode both bed and banks during moderate flows. Observations of natural channels suggest that the channel shape as well as the dimensions of meandering rivers appear to be associated with flows at or near the bankfull stage. The fact that the bankfull stage recurs on the average once every year or two years indicates that these features of many alluvial rivers are controlled by these more frequent flows rather than by the rarer events of catastrophic magnitude. Because the equilibrium form of wind-blown dunes and of wave-formed beaches is quite unstable, the frequency of the events responsible for their form is less clearly definable. However, dune form and orientation are determined by both wind velocity and frequency. Similarly, a hypothetical example suggests that beach slope oscillates about a mean value related in part to wave characteristics generated by winds of moderate speed. Where stresses generated by frequent events are incompetent to transport available materials, less frequent ones of greater magnitude are obviously required. Closer observation of many geomorphic processes is required before the relative importance of different processes and of events of differing magnitude and frequency in the formation of given features of the landscape can be adequately evaluated.},

abstract = {Bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers impacts channel stability, the lifespan of hydraulic structures, physical components of aquatic habitat, and long-term channel evolution. Field measurements of bedload transport are notoriously difficult, which precludes understanding many of the processes and mechanics associated with grain motion. Such uncertainties are exacerbated when using bedload transport equations, most of which were derived using data from a single river or set of laboratory flume experiments. Recently, laboratory experiments have focused on better quantifying the processes that impact bedload fluxes, which can then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. We highlight recent advances in laboratory instrumentation that can be used in bedload transport studies. In particular, more accurate ways to measure bedload fluxes, near-bed turbulence, bed grain sizes, and topography hold great promise. Laboratory experiments have also fundamentally improved our understanding of the influence of sediment supply and armoring processes on bedload fluxes and channel conditions. The importance of flow hydrographs in controlling total bedload transport rates and bedload hysteresis has also been demonstrated using flume experiments. Finally, many details about the mechanics of grain motion including flow turbulence, bed arrangement, and particle transport statistics are only possible through laboratory investigations, and we feature key knowledge gaps that can be improved with further study.},

abstract = {The diversity of aquatic habitats in streams is linked to physical processes that act at various spatial and temporal scales. Two components of many that contribute to creating habitat heterogeneity in streams are the interaction between sediment supply and transport capacity and the presence of local in-stream structures, such as large woody debris and boulders. Data from previously published flume and field studies and a new field study on tributaries to the South Yuba River in Nevada County, California, USA, were used to evaluate the relationship between habitat heterogeneity, local in-stream structural features and relative sediment supply. Habitat heterogeneity was quantified using spatial heterogeneity measures from the field of landscape ecology. Relative sediment supply, as expressed by the sediment supply/transport capacity ratio, which controls channel morphology and substrate textures, two key physical habitat characteristics, was quantified using a dimensionless bedload transport ratio, q⁎. Calculated q⁎ values were plotted against an ecologically meaningful heterogeneity index, Shannon's Diversity Index, measured for each study reach, as well as the percent area of in-stream structural elements. The results indicate two potential mechanisms for how relative sediment supply may drive geomorphic diversity in natural river systems at the reach scale. When less mobile structural elements form a small proportion of the reach landscape, the supply/capacity ratio dictates the range of sediment textures and geomorphic features observed within the reach. In these settings, channels with a moderate relative sediment supply exhibit the highest textural and geomorphic diversity. In contrast, when less mobile structural elements are abundant, forced local scour and deposition creates high habitat heterogeneity, even in the presence of high relative sediment supply.},

abstract = {Boundary waves often form at the interface between ice and fluid flowing adjacent to it, such as ripples under river ice covers, and steps on the bed of supraglacial meltwater channels. They may also be formed by wind, such as the megadunes on the Antarctic ice sheet. Spiral troughs on the polar ice caps of Mars have been interpreted to be cyclic steps formed by katabatic wind blowing over ice. Cyclic steps are relatives of upstream-migrating antidunes. Cyclic step formation on ice is not only a mechanical but also a thermodynamic process. There have been very few studies on the formation of either cyclic steps or upstream-migrating antidunes on ice. In this study, we performed flume experiments to reproduce cyclic steps on ice by flowing water, and found that trains of steps form when the Froude number is larger than unity. The features of those steps allow them to be identified as ice-bed analogs of cyclic steps in alluvial and bedrock rivers. We performed a linear stability analysis and obtained a physical explanation of the formation of upstream-migrating antidunes, i.e., precursors of cyclic steps. We compared the results of experiments with the predictions of the analysis and found the observed steps fall in the range where the analysis predicts interfacial instability. We also found that short antidune-like undulations formed as a precursor to the appearance of well-defined steps. This fact suggests that such antidune-like undulations correspond to the instability predicted by the analysis and are precursors of cyclic steps.},

abstract = {Abstract Morphodynamic equilibrium is a widely adopted yet elusive concept in the field of geomorphology of coasts, rivers and estuaries. Based on the Exner equation, an expression of mass conservation of sediment, we distinguish three types of equilibrium defined as static and dynamic, of which two different types exist. Other expressions such as statistical and quasi-equilibrium which do not strictly satisfy the Exner conditions are also acknowledged for their practical use. The choice of a temporal scale is imperative to analyse the type of equilibrium. We discuss the difference between morphodynamic equilibrium in the “real world” (nature) and the “virtual world” (model). Modelling studies rely on simplifications of the real world and lead to understanding of process interactions. A variety of factors affect the use of virtual-world predictions in the real world (e.g., variability in environmental drivers and variability in the setting) so that the concept of morphodynamic equilibrium should be mathematically unequivocal in the virtual world and interpreted over the appropriate spatial and temporal scale in the real world. We draw examples from estuarine settings which are subject to various governing factors which broadly include hydrodynamics, sedimentology and landscape setting. Following the traditional “tide-wave-river” ternary diagram, we summarize studies to date that explore the “virtual world”, discuss the type of equilibrium reached and how it relates to the real world.},

abstract = {Field research on step–pool channels has largely focused on the dimensions and sequence of steps and pools and how these features vary with slope, grain sizes and other governing variables. Measurements by different investigators are frequently compared, yet no means to identify steps and pools objectively have been used. Automated surveying instruments record the morphology of streams in unprecedented detail making it possible to objectively identify steps and pools, provided an appropriate classification procedure can be developed. To achieve objective identification of steps and pools from long profile survey data, we applied a series of scale-free geometric rules that include minimum step length (2.25{\%} of bankfull width (Wb)), minimum pool length (10{\%} of Wb), minimum residual depth (0.23{\%} of Wb), minimum drop height (3.3{\%} of Wb), and minimum step slope (10° greater than the mean slope). The rules perform as well as the mean response of 11 step–pool researchers who were asked to classify four long profiles, and the results correspond well with the channel morphologies identified during the field surveys from which the long profiles were generated. The method outperforms four other techniques that have been proposed. Sensitivity analysis shows that the method is most sensitive to the choice of minimum pool length and minimum drop height. Detailed bed scans of a step–pool channel created in a flume reveal that a single long profile with a fixed sampling interval poorly characterizes the steps and pools; five or more long profiles spread across the channel are required if a fixed sampling interval is used and the data suggest that survey points should be located more frequently than the diameter of the step-forming material. A single long profile collected by a surveyor who chooses breaks in slope and representative survey points was found to adequately characterize the mean bed profile.},

abstract = {The present paper aims to bridge analytical models with field observations on bar morphodynamics in alluvial gravel-bed rivers by examining the outcomes of their application to several river reaches with both single-and multiple-thread morphology. Analytical bar models have often been validated through controlled flume experiments while application to real rivers still poses several challenges. Moreover, despite evidence that alternate and mid-channel bar patterns significantly affect the morphodynamics of transitional and braided rivers, analytical bar models have never been applied to multiple thread streams because they are formulated referring to a single channel with totally sediment-transporting cross section. The paper reviews recent developments on the role of steady bars in single-thread channels and on the dynamics of migrating bars in braided rivers. A key ingredient for sound application is a suitable computation of model input parameters that must be based on the morphologically active portion of the cross section of the analyzed reach. This results in effective prediction of spatial scales, channel pattern, and processes of bedform-planform interaction in many diverse field situations, despite the simplifying assumptions of analytical models. These models can therefore be employed to improve present understanding of the dynamics of multiple-thread rivers, which has often been limited by their complexity. One of the most limiting assumptions of the analytical models is the strong separation between the timescales of bed and bank processes, which leads to a decoupled approach. This appears as one of the major challenges that shall be addressed by future research.},
